I tried three different datasets:

- metallica.txt (all metallica lyrics with authors for each songs)
- digitranfs.txt (5 books on digital transformation, with summary and non-text parts cutted off)

On my local machine, the script can't run. It stays at 100% CPU, I needed to stop the kernel in order to avoid to fry CPU (funny update: actually my computer died anyway about a month later, I guess that overwork did not help)

On Google Colab, I was surprise to find out that using a Runtime with  GPU (you have to pick this in the settings), the run took like 1/10 or even less of the time (update: GPU to CPU ratio is exactly 1/10).
This allows me to experiment a little.

Metallica text generation went good and bad. Good cause the model generates a somehow meaningful song text. Bad cause the generated song lyric was heavily dependend on the dataset (es. some strings were like "nothing else matters" or "ride the lightning").
I tried with an higher amount of EPOCH (up to 90), with no significant improvement.
(update: now running with some deep traning, over 1000 epoch. Still don't have a clean run to check)

Digital transformation text generation went from very bad to moderately bad.
I tried with different EPOCH size (up to 90) and I saw that after like 20 EPOCH the loss function increased and the accuracy dropped. IDK. Need to study\investigate further.
With 20 EPOCH the run with GPU was very fast, the result was "moderately bad" in the sense that it was at least in plain English(-ish). But the text is far from being significant and some words are totally out of context (such as "dollars with data"). I have no further elements to tweak atm and i need to study further the models and the theory behind RNN to be able to improve the results.
