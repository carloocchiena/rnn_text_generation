[James Hetfield]
[Lars Ulrich]

No life till leather
We are gonna kick some ass tonight
We got the metal madness
When our fans start screaming
It's right well alright
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again

We are gonna blow this place away
with volume higher
Than anything today the only way
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again

Hit the lights
Hit the lights

We are gonna rip right through your brain
We got the lethal power
It is causing you sweet pain Oh sweet pain
When we start to rock

2. The Four Horsemen

[James Hetfield]
[Lars Ulrich]
[D. Mustaine]

By the last breath of the fourth winds blow
Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knocks at your door
Lock up your wife and children now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you have got some company

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four Horsemen ride
or choose your fate and die

You have been dying since the day
You were born
You know it has all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once a sinner twice
No need for confession now
Cause now you have got the fight of your life

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four Horsemen ride
or choose your fate and die

Time
has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine
Your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
For what you have had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death
Deliverance for you for sure
There is nothing you can do

So gather round young warriors now
and saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgment hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four Horsemen ride
or choose your fate and die


3. Motorbreath

[James Hetfield]

Living and dying laughing and crying
Once you have seen it you will never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it's heavy, it's dirty and mean

Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is going to take
Your breath away

Don't stop for nothing it's full speed or nothing
I am taking down you know whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down your spine

Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is going to take
Your breath away

Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life is about
You only live once so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others the same song and dance

Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is going to take
Your breath away

[James Hetfield]
[Lars Ulrich]
[D. Mustaine]

Down in the depths of my fiery home
The summons bell will chime
Tempting you and all the earth
to join our sinful kind
There is a job to be done and I'm the one
You people make me do it
Now it is time for your fate and I won't hesitate
to pull you down into this pit

So come on
Jump in the Fire
So come on
Jump in the Fire

With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins
The end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man
and from their souls within
My disciples all shout to search out
And they always shall obey
Follow me now my child not the meek or the mild
But do just as I say

So come on
Jump in the Fire
So come on
Jump in the Fire

Jump by your will or be taken by force
I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit
I am stalking you as prey
Living your life as me I am you you see
There is part of me in everyone
So reach down grab my hand walk with me through the land
Come home where you belong

So come on
Jump in the Fire
So come on
Jump in the Fire

[James Hetfield]
[Lars Ulrich]

Late at night all systems go
You have come to see the show
We do our best You're the rest
You make it real you know
There is a feeling deep inside
That drives you fuckin' mad
A feeling of a hammerhead
You need it oh so bad

Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash

Bang your head against the stage
Like you never did before
Make it ring Make it bleed
Make it really sore
In a frenzied madness
with your leather and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around
It is hot as hell tonight

Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash

Here on the stage the Marshal noise
is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass kick your face
Exploding feeling nears
Now is the time to let it rip
To let it fuckin' loose
We are gathered here to be with you
Cause this is what we choose

Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash

The show is through the metal is gone
It is time to hit the road
Another town Another gig
Again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways
Life out here is raw
But we will never stop
We will never quit
cause we are Metallica

Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac


7. Phantom Lord

[James Hetfield]
[Lars Ulrich]
[D. Mustaine]

Sound is ripping through your ears
The deafening sound of metal nears
Your bodies waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips

Hear the cry of War
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
to control the land
Crushing metal strikes
on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord

Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying dying pains
The fists of terrors breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do

Hear the cry of War
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
to control the land
Crushing metal strikes
on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord

The leather armies have prevailed
The Phantom Lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume metal sound

Hear the cry of War
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
to control the land
Crushing metal strikes
on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord

Fall to your knees
and bow to the PhantomLord


8. No Remorse

[James Hetfield]
[Lars Ulrich]

No mercy for what we are doing
No thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one

War without end
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath

Blood feeds the war machine
as it eats its way across the land
We don't need the feel the sorrow
No remorse is the one command

War without end
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath

Only the strong survive
No one to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face

War without end
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath

Attack
Bullets are flying
People are dying
with madness surrounding all hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going
Blood starts to flowing
No mercy given to anyone hear
The furious fighting
Swords are like lighting
It all becomes frightening to you
Know death is near
No remorse


9. Seek & Destroy

[James Hetfield]
[Lars Ulrich]

We are scanning the scene
in the city tonight
We are looking for you
to start up a fight
There is an evil feeling
in our brains
But it is nothing new
you know it drives us insane

Running,
On our way
Hiding,
You will pay
Dying,
One thousand deaths
Running,

Hiding,

There is no escape
and that is for sure
This is the end we won't take any more
Say goodbye
to the world you live in
You have always been taking
but now you're giving

Running,
On our way
Hiding,
You will pay
Dying,
One thousand deaths
Running,
On our way
Hiding,
You will pay
Dying,
One thousand deaths
Searching,

Our brains are on fire
with the feeling to kill
And it won't go away
until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing
on our minds
Don't try running away
`cause you're the one we will find

Running,
On our way
Hiding,
You will pay
Dying,
One thousand deaths
Running,
On our way
Hiding,
You will pay
Dying,
One thousand deaths
Searching,
Seek and Destroy
Searching,
Seek and Destroy
Searching,
Seek and Destroy
Searching,
Seek and Destroy

[Lars Ulrich]
[D. Mustaine]

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing

Metal Militia

Chained and shadowed to be left behind
nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice

Join or be conquered the law of the land

The metallization of your inner soul
twisting and turning

On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal Militia

Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal Militia

[Metallica, originally performed by Diamond Head (Recorded in 1982)]
[- words and music by Brian Tatler and Sean Lindon Harris]

My mother was a witch, she was burned alive.
Thankless little bitch, for the tears I cried.
Take her down now, don't want to see her face
All blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace.

Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
See their bodies out on the ice.
Take my time.

Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.

As I watched my mother die, I lost my head.
Revenge now I sought, to break with my bread.
Taking no chances, you come with me.
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free.

Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
See their bodies out on the ice.
Take my time.

Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.

On with the action now, I'll strip your pride.
I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride.
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat.
Like a double dozen before ya, smells so sweet.

Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.

I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire.
You can come with me, sweet desire.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.

Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.

My soul is longing for, await my heir.
Sent to avenge my mother, sweep myself.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.

Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.

Am I evil? Yes I fucking am.
Am I evil? I am man, yeah.

[Metallica, originally performed by Blitzkrieg (Recorded in 1981)]
[- words and music by Ian Jones, Brian Smith and James Sirotto]

Let us have peace, let us have life,
Let us escape the cruel night.
Let us have time, let the sun shine,
Let us beware the deadly sign.

The day is coming, armageddon's near,
Inferno's coming, can we survive the blitzkrieg.
The blitzkrieg, the blitzkrieg.

Save us from fate, save us from hate,
Save ourselves before it's too late.
Come to our need, hear our plea,
Save ourselves before the earth bleeds.

The day is dawning, the time is near,
Aliens calling, can we survive the blitzkrieg.

1. Fight Fire With Fire

Do unto others as they have done unto you
But what in the hell is this world coming to?
Blow the universe into nothingness
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest

[chorus:]

Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear
We all shall die

Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast
Armageddon is here, like said in the past

[chorus:]

Soon to fill our lungs the hot winds of death
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath

[chorus:]


2. Ride The Lightning

Guilty as charged
But damn it, it ain't right
There is someone else controlling me
Death in the air
Strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me
Who made you God to say
"I'll take your life from you!"

[chorus:]

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flames

Wait for the sign
To flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end
Sweat, chilling cold
As I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend
My fingers grip with fear
What I am doing here?

[chorus:]

Someone help me
Oh please God help me
They are trying to take it all away
I don't want to die
Time moving slowly
The minutes seem like hours
The final curtain call I see
How true is this?
Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be
Wakened by the horrid scream
Freed from the frightening dream

[chorus:]


3. For Whom The Bell Tolls

Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for the right, yes but who's to say?
For a hill men would kill why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from this pain that they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Take a look to the sky just before you die
It is the last time you will
Blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they will see what will be, blinded eyes to see

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls


4. Fade To Black

Life it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free

Things are not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filing me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now He's gone

No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death Greets me warm, now I will just say good-bye


5. Trapped Under Ice

I don't know how to live trough this hell
Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core
Break the ice, I can't take anymore

Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under the ice

Crystallized, as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I say

Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under the ice

Scream from my soul
Fate, mystified
Hell, forever more
No release from my cryonic state
What is this? I've been stricken by fate
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me

Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under the ice


6. Escape

Feel no pain, but my life ain't easy
I know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end
To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidity

Out of my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life is for my own to live my own way

Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell my what to do
I don't care now, 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you
Feed my brain with your so called standards
Who says that I ain't right
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sight

Out of my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life is for my own to live my own way

See they try to bring the hammer down
No damn chains can hold me to the ground
Life is for my own to live my own way


7. Creeping Death

Slaves
Hebrews born to serve, to the pharaoh
Heed
To his every word, live in fear
Faith
Of the unknown one, the deliverer
Wait
Something must be done, four hundred years

So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

Now
Let my people go, land of goshen
Go
I will be with thee, bush of fire
Blood
Running red and strong, down the Nile
Plague
Darkness three days long, hail to fire

So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first born man
Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first born man

I
Rule the midnight air the destroyer
Born
I shall soon be there, deadly mass
I
Creep the steps and flood final darkness
Blood
Lambs blood painted door, I shall pass

So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

1. Battery

Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the Battery
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the Battery

Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me

Battery

Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never ending potency
Hungry violence seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the Battery
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the Battery

Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me

Battery

Circle of Destruction, Hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, Dominating flurry
We create the Battery

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the Battery
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the Battery

Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me

2. Master Of Puppets

End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking dark is clear
Leading on your deaths construction

Taste me you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your Master
Your life burns faster
Obey your Master

Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream

How I'm killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your Master
Your life burns faster
Obey your Master

Master, Master, where's the dreams that I've been after?
Master, Master, you promised only lies
Laughter, Laughter, all I hear or see is laughter
Laughter, Laughter, laughing at my cries
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Neverending maze, drift on numbered days
now your life is out of season
I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

Come crawling faster
Obey your Master
Your life burns faster
Obey your Master

3. The Thing That Should Not Be

Messenger of Fear in sight
Dark deception kills the light

Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for Father, roaming free

Fearless Wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Great Old One
Forbidden site
He searches
Hunter of the Shadows is rising

Immortal
In madness You dwell

Crawling Chaos, underground
Cult has summoned, twisted sound

Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city, living death

Fearless Wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Timeless sleep
Has been upset
He awakens
Hunter of the Shadows is rising

Immortal
In madness You dwell

Not dead which eternal lie
Stranger eons Death may die
Drain you of your sanity
Face The Thing That Should Not Be

Fearless Wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Great Old One
Forbidden site
He searches
Hunter of the Shadows is rising


4. Welcome Home (Sanitarium)

Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, No windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred

Sleep my friend and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says Rage

Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Build my fear of what's out there
And cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?

No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell

Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again.


5. Disposable Heroes

Bodies fill the fields I see, hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be
A servant 'til I fall

Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here, greeting death
He's yours to take away

Back to the front
You will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front
You coward
You servant
You blind man

Barking of machine-gun fire, does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you wear, glory seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see
The slaughter never ends

Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here, greeting death
He's yours to take away

Back to the front
You will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front
You coward
You servant
You blind man

Why, am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, Hell is here

Why, am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, Hell is here

I was born for dying

Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself, molded day by day
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend
Alone I clench my gun

Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here, greeting death
He's yours to take away

Back to the front
You will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front
You coward
You servant
You blind man

Back to the front.
Back to the front.
Back to the front.
Back to the front.
Back to the front.


6. Leper Messiah

Spineless from the start, sucked into the part
Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown
Please, please
Spreading his disease, living by his story
Knees, knees
Falling to your knees, suffer for his glory
You will

Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get a better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah

Marvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came, rotting your brain
Chain, chain
Join the endless chain
Taken by his glamour
Fame, Fame
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power
We see

Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get a better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah

Bow to Leper Messiah
Witchery, weakening
Sees the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you follow

Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get a better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah

Lie.

8. Damage, Inc.

Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard and no one's gonna give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the end

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage Incorporated

Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life ain't for you and we're the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fall

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage Incorporated

We chew and spit you out
We laugh, you scream and shout
All flee, with fear you run
You'll know just where we come from

Damage Incorporated

Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this, it gets me goin'
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy ending on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage Inc. you see
Step a little closer if you please

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage Incorporated

1. Blackened

Blackened is the end
Winter it will send
Throwing all you see
Into obscurity

Death of Mother Earth
Never a rebirth
Evolution’s end
Never will it mend

Never

Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened

Blistering of earth
Terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine
Kills what might have been

Callous frigid chill
Nothing left to kill
Never seen before
Breathing nevermore

Never

Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened

Blackened

Opposition...contradiction...premonition...compromise
Agitation...violation...mutilation...planet dies

Darkest color
Blistered earth
True death of life

Termination...expiration...cancellation...human race
Expectation...liberation...population...lay to waste

See our mother
Put to death
See our mother die

Smoldering decay
Take her breath away
Millions of our years
In minutes disappears

Darkening in vain
Decadence remains
All is said and done
Never is the sun

Never

Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Fire
Is the outcome of hypocrisy
Darkest potency
In the exit of humanity
Color our world blackened

Blackened


2. ...And Justice For All

Halls of justice painted green
Money talking
Power wolves beset your door
Hear them stalking
Soon you’ll please their appetite
They devour
Hammer of justice crushes you
Overpower

The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can’t believe the things you say
I can’t believe
I can’t believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you

Justice is lost
Justice is raped
Justice is gone
Pulling your strings
Justice is done
Seeking no truth
Winning is all
Find it so grim
So true
So real

Apathy their stepping stone
So unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity
So deceiving
Through your eyes their light burns
Hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you
With prying minds

The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can’t believe the things you say
I can’t believe
I can’t believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you

Justice is lost
Justice is raped
Justice is gone
Pulling your strings
Justice is done
Seeking no truth
Winning is all
Find it so grim
So true
So real

Lady Justice has been raped
Truth assassin
Rolls of red tape seal your lips
Now you’re done in
Their money tips her scales again
Make your deal
Just what is truth? I cannot tell
Cannot feel

The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can’t believe the things you say
I can’t believe
I can’t believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you

Justice is lost
Justice is raped
Justice is gone
Pulling your strings
Justice is done
Seeking no truth
Winning is all
Find it so grim
So true
So real

Seeking no truth
Winning is all
Find it so grim
So true
So real


3. Eye Of The Beholder

Do you see what I see?
Truth is an offence
Your silence for your confidence

Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must

Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?

Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd

Doesn’t matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it’s done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me

Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative

Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own

Do you trust what I trust?
Me, myself and I
Penetrate the smoke screen, I see through the selfish lie

Doesn’t matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it’s done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

Do you know what I know?
Your money and your wealth
Your silence just to hear yourself

Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence, lengthen freedom’s ring

Doesn’t matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it’s done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom no longer frees you
Doesn’t matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it’s done just how I say


4. One

I can’t remember anything
Can’t tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me

Now that the war is through with me
I’m waking up, I cannot see
That there’s not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me

Back in the womb it’s much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can’t look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I’ll live

Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me

Now the world is gone, I’m just one
Oh God, help me Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, help me

Darkness
Imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell

Landmine
Has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell


5. The Shortest Straw

Suspicion is your name
Your honesty to blame
Put dignity to shame
Dishonor
Witchhunt, modern day
Determining decay
The blatant disarray
Disfigure
The public eye’s disgrace
Defying common place
Unending paper chase
Unending

Deafening
Painstaking
Reckoning
This vertigo it doth bring

Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
Shortest straw
The shortest straw has been pulled for you

Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
The shortest straw has been pulled for you

The accusations fly
Discrimination, why?
Your inner self to die
Intruding
Doubt sunk itself in you
Its teeth and talons through
You’re living Catch-22
Deluding
A mass hysteria
A megalomania
Reveal dementia
Reveal

Secretly
Silently
Certainly
In vertigo you will be

Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
Shortest straw
This shortest straw has been pulled for you

Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Shortest straw has been pulled for you
Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Shortest straw has been pulled for you

Behind you, hands are tied
Your being, ostracized
Your hell is multiplied
Upending
The fallout has begun
Oppressive damage done
Your many turned to none
To nothing
You’re reaching your nadir
Your will has disappeared
The lie is crystal clear
Defending

Channels red
One word said
Blacklisted
With vertigo make you dead

Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
Shortest straw
The shortest straw has been pulled for you
Pulled for you


6. Harvester Of Sorrow

My life suffocates
Planting seeds of hate
I’ve loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fate

I give, you take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth

Anger
Misery
You’ll suffer unto me

Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow

Pure black, looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to me
Get back which used to be

Drink up
Shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain
Your loss becomes my gain

Anger
Misery
You’ll suffer unto me

Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow

All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes
You’ll find where murder lies

Infanticide

Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow


7. The Frayed Ends Of Sanity

Never hunger
Never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure
Struggle within
Triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends

Twisting under schizophrenia
Falling deep into dementia

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone’s after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me

Birth of terror
Death of much more
I’m the slave of fear, my captor
Never warnings
Spreading its wings
As I wait for the horror she brings

Loss of interest, question, wonder
Waves of fear they pull me under

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone’s after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me

Into ruin
I am sinking
Hostage of this nameless feeling
Hell is set free
Flooded I’ll be
Feel the undertow inside me

Height, hell, time, haste, terror, tension
Life, death, want, waste, mass depression

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Myself is after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me


8. To Live Is To Die

When a man lies he murders some part of the world
These are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives
All this I cannot bear to witness any longer
Cannot the kingdom of salvation take me home


9. Dyers Eve

Dear Mother
Dear Father
What is this hell you have put me through
Believer
Deceiver
Day in, day out, live my life through you
Pushed onto me what’s wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life

Dear Mother
Dear Father
Every thought I’d think you’d disapprove
Curator
Dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired

Innocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I’m living blindly

Dear Mother
Dear Father
Time has frozen still what’s left to be
Hear nothing
Say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee, it’s life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance

Dear Mother
Dear Father
You’ve clipped my wings before I learned to fly
Unspoiled
Unspoken
I’ve outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I’ve always heard from you
Do as I say, not as I do

Innocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I’m living blindly

I’m in hell without you
Cannot cope without you two
Shocked at the world that I see
Innocent victim please rescue me

Dear Mother
Dear Father
Hidden in your world you’ve made for me
I’m seething
I’m bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite I feel for you
Living out this hell you always knew

1. Enter Sandman

[Hetfield / Ulrich / Hammet]

Say your prayers little one
Don't forget, my son,
To include everyone

Tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the sandman he comes

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
Off to never never land

Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of snow white

Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
Off to never never land

Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Pray the lord my soul to take

Hush, little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beast under your bed,
In your closet, in your head

Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
Off to never never land


2. Sad But True

[Hetfield / Ulrich]

Hey
I'm your life
I'm the one who takes you there
Hey
I'm your life
I'm the one who cares
They
They betray
I'm your only true friend now
They
They'll betray
I'm forever there

I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true

I'm your dream, mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
You know it's sad but true

Sad but true

You
You're my mask
You're my cover, my shelter
You
You're my mask
You're the one who's blamed
Do
Do my work
Do my dirty work, scapegoat
Do
Do my deeds
For you're the one who's shamed

I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true

I'm your dream, mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
You know it's sad but true

Sad but true

[2x]
I'm your dream
I'm your eyes
I'm your pain

You know it's sad but true

Hate
I'm your hate
I'm your hate when you want love
Pay
Pay the price
Pay, for nothing's fair

Hey
I'm your life
I'm the one who took you there
Hey
I'm your life
And I no longer care

I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true

I'm your truth, telling lies
I'm your reasoned alibis
I'm inside open your eyes
I'm you

Sad but true


3. Holier Than Thou

[Hetfield / Ulrich]

No more!
The craps rolls out your mouth again
Haven't changed, your brain is still gelatin
Little whispers circle around your head
Why don't you worry about yourself instead

Who are you? Where ya been? Where ya from?
Gossip is burning on the tip of your tongue
You lie so much you believe yourself
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself

Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou
You are

You know not

Before you judge me take a look at you
Can't you find something better to do
Point the finger, slow to understand
Arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand

It's not who you are it's who you know
Others lives are the basis of your own
Burn your bridges build them back with wealth
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself

Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou
You are

You know not


4. The Unforgiven

[Hetfield / Ulrich / Hammet]

New blood joins this earth,
And quickly he's subdued.
Through constant pained disgrace
The young boy learns their rules.

With time the child draws in.
This whipping boy done wrong.
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and on.

He's known a vow unto his own,
That never from this day
His will they'll take away.

What I've felt,
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown.
Never be.
Never see.
Won't see what might have been.

What I've felt,
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown.
Never free.
Never me.
So I dub thee unforgiven.

They dedicate their lives
To running all of his.
He tries to please them all –
This bitter man he is.

Throughout his life the same –
He's battled constantly.
This fight he cannot win –
A tired man they see no longer cares.

The old man then prepares
To die regretfully –
That old man here is me.

What I've felt,
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown.
Never be.
Never see.
Won't see what might have been.

What I've felt,
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown.
Never free.
Never me.
So I dub thee unforgiven.

[Solo]

What I've felt,
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown.
Never be.
Never see.
Won't see what might have been.

What I've felt,
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown.
Never free.
Never me.
So I dub thee unforgiven.

Never free.
Never me.
So I dub thee unforgiven.

You labelled me,
I'll label you.
So I dub thee unforgiven.

Never free.
Never me.
So I dub thee unforgiven.

You labelled me,
I'll label you.
So I dub thee unforgiven.

Never free.
Never me.
So I dub thee unforgiven.


5. Wherever I May Roam

[Hetfield / Ulrich]

(...and the road becomes my bride)⟓
...and the road becomes my bride
I have stripped of all but pride
So in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied
Gives me all I need

...and with dust in throat I crave
Only knowledge will I save
To the game you stay a slave

Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will

But I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I may roam
Where I lay my head is home

(...and the Earth becomes my throne)
...and the Earth becomes my throne
I adapt to the unknown
Under wandering stars I've grown
By myself but not alone
I ask no one

...and my ties are severed clean
The less I have the more I gain
Off the beaten path I reign

Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll never mind anywhere
Anywhere I may roam
Where I lay my head is home

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll never mind anywhere
Anywhere I may roam
Where I lay my head is home, that's right

[Solo]

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind
And I'll take my find anywhere
Anywhere I may roam
Where I lay my head is home

Carved upon my stone
My body lie, but still I roam

Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam, yeah
Wherever I may wander, wander, wander
Wherever I may roam
Yeah, yeah! Wherever I may roam
Yeah, yeah! Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam…


6. Don't Tread On Me

[Hetfield / Ulrich]

Liberty or death, what we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her, rattling of her tail
Never begins it, never, but once engaged...
Never surrenders, showing the fangs of rage

Don't tread on me

So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
Settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore...

Don't tread on me

Love it or live it, she with the deadly bite
Quick is the blue tongue, forked as lighting strike
Shining with brightness, always on surveillance
The eyes, they never close, emblem of vigilance

Don't tread on me

So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
Settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore...

Don't tread on me

So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war

Liberty or death, what we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her, rattling on her tail

So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
Settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore...

Don't tread on me


7. Through The Never

[Hetfield / Ulrich / Hammet]

All that is, was and will be
Universe much too big to see

Time and space never ending
Disturbing thoughts, questions pending
Limitations of human understanding
Too quick to criticize
Obligation to survive
We hunger to be alive

All that is, ever
Ever was
Will be ever
Twisting
Turning
Through the never

In the dark, see past our eyes
Pursuit of truth no matter where it lies

Gazing up to the breeze of the heavens
On a quest, meaning, reason
Came to be, how it begun
All alone in the family of the sun
Curiosity teasing everyone
On our home, third stone from the sun

All that is, ever
Ever was
Will be ever
Twisting
Turning
Through the never

On through the never
We must go
On through the never
Out of the
Edge of forever
We must go
On through the never
Then ever comes

All that is, ever
Ever was
Will be ever
Who we are
Ask forever
Twisting
Turning
Through the never

Never


8. Nothing Else Matters

[Hetfield / Ulrich / Hammet]

So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know

[Solo]

So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
No, nothing else matters


9. Of Wolf And Man

[Hetfield / Ulrich / Hammet]

Off through the new day's mist I run
Off from the new day's mist I have come
I hunt
Therefore I am
Harvest the land
Taking of the fallen lamb

Off through the new day's mist I run
Off from the new day's mist I have come
We shift
Pulsing with the earth
Company we keep
Roaming the land while you sleep

Shape shift nose to the wind
Shape shift feeling I've been
Move swift all senses clean
Earth's gift back to the meaning of life

Bright is the moon high in starlight
Chill is the air cold as steel tonight
We shift
Call of the wild
Fear in your eyes
It's later than you realized

Shape shift nose to the wind
Shape shift feeling I've been
Move swift all senses clean
Earth's gift back to the meaning of life

I feel I change
Back to a better day
Hair stands on the back of my neck
In wildness is the preservation of the world

So seek the wolf in thyself

Shape shift nose to the wind
Shape shift feeling I've been
Move swift all senses clean
Earth's gift
Back to the meaning of wolf and man


10. The God That Failed

[Hetfield / Ulrich]

Pride you took
Pride you feel
Pride that you felt when you'd kneel

Not the word
Not the love
Not what you thought from above

It feeds
It grows
It clouds all that you will know
Deceit
Deceive
Decide just what you believe

I see faith in your eyes
Never your hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail

Follow the god that failed

Find your peace
Find your say
Find the smooth road in your way

Trust you gave
A child to save
Left you cold and him in grave

It feeds
It grows
It clouds all that you will know
Deceit
Deceive
Decide just what you believe

I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail

Follow the god that failed

I see faith in your eyes
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail

Follow the god that failed

Pride you took
Pride you feel
Pride that you felt when you'd kneel

Trust you gave
A child to save
Left you cold and him in grave

I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by deepened nail

Follow the god that failed


11. My Friend Of Misery

[Hetfield / Ulrich / Newsted]

You just stood there screaming
Fearing no one was listening to you
They say the empty can rattles the most
The sound of your voice must soothe you
Hearing only what you want to hear
And knowing only what you've heard
You you're smothered in tragedy
You're out to save the world

Misery
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
Misery
There's much more to life than what you see
My friend of misery

You still stood there screaming
No one caring about these words you tell
My friend before your voice is gone
One man's fun is another's hell
These times are sent to try men's souls
But something's wrong with all you see
You you'll take it on all yourself
Remember, misery loves company

Misery
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
Misery
There's much more to life than what you see
My friend of misery

You just stood there screaming
My friend of misery


12. The Struggle Within

[Hetfield / Ulrich]

Reaching out for something you've got to feel
While clutching to what you had thought was real

Kicking at a dead horse pleases you
No way of showing your gratitude
So many things you don't want to do
What is it? What have you got to lose

What the hell
What is you think you're gonna find?
Hypocrite
Boredom sets into the boring mind

Struggle within it suits you fine
Struggle within your ruin
Struggle within you seal your own coffin
Struggle within the struggling within

Home is not a home it becomes a hell
Turning it into your prison cell
Advantages are taken, not handed out
While you struggle inside your hell

Reaching out
Grabbing for something you've got to feel
Closing in
The pressure upon you is so real

Struggle within it suits you fine
Struggle within your ruin
Struggle within you seal your own coffin
Struggle within the struggling within

Reaching out for something you've got to feel
While clutching to what you had thought was real
What the hell

What is you think you're gonna find
Hypocrite
Boredom sets into the boring mind

Struggle within it suits you fine
Struggle within your ruin
Struggle within you seal your own coffin
Struggle within the struggling within

1. Ain't My Bitch

Outta my way
Outta my day
Out of your mind and into mine

Into no one
Into not one
Into your step but out of time

Headstrong
What's wrong?
I've already heard this song before
You arrived, but now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye

Dragging me down
Why you around?
So useless

It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitch
It ain't my bitch

Down on the sun
Down and no fun
Down and out, where the hell you been?

Damn it all down
Damn it unbound
Damn it all down to hell again

Stand tall
Can't fall
Never even bend at all before
You arrived, but now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye

Dragging me down
Why you around?
So useless

It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitch

Outta my way

Outta my way
Outta my day
Out of your mind and into mine

Into no one
Into not one
Into your step but out of time

Headstrong
What's wrong?
I've already heard this song before
You arrived, but now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye
And now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye

Dragging me down
Why you around?
So useless

It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitch

No way but down
Why you're around?
No fooling

It ain't my smile
It ain't my style
It ain't my bitch
Oh, it ain't mine

Ain't mine
Your kind
You're stepping out of time

Ain't mine
Your kind
You're stepping out of time

Taking me down
Why you around?
No fooling

It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitch
You ain't mine


2. 2 x 4

I'm gonna make you, shake you, take you
I'm gonna be the one who breaks you
Put the screws to you, yeah, my way
Yeah, come on and come on, come and make my day
Make my day

Got some hell to pay, I steal your thunder
The joy of violent movement pulls you under
Bite the bullet, well, hard
Yeah, but I die harder, so go too far
Too far

Friction, fusion, retribution
I can't hear you talk to me
I can't hear you. So talk to me
I can't hear you. Are you talking to me?
I can't hear you. Are you talking to me?
I can't hear you. Time to meet my lord
I can't hear you talk to two by four

I'm gonna make you, shake you, take you
I'm gonna be the one who breaks you
Put the screws to you, my way
Hey, come on and come on, come and make my day
Make my day

Friction, fusion, retribution
I can't hear you talk to me
I can't hear you. Come talk to me
I can't hear you. Are you talking to me?

I'm gonna trick you. So talk to me
I can't hear you. Are you talking to me?
I can't hear you. You talking to me?

3. The House Jack Built

Open door, so I walk inside
Close my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin

Open my eyes just to have them close again
Well on my way, but on my way to where I've been
It swallows me as it takes me in its fog
I twist away as I give this world the nod

Open door, so I walk inside
Close my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin

Open my eyes just to have them closed once again
Don't want control
As it takes me down and down and down again
Is that the moon or just a light that lights this dead-end street?
Is that you there or just another demon that I meet?

The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Step into the house that Jack built

The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Yes, this is the house that Jack built

Open door, yes, I walk inside
Swallow me so the pain subsides
And I shake as I take the sin
Let the show begin

Let the show begin
Let the show begin

The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Yes, this is the house that Jack built

The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Yes, I am, I am, I am

Open my eyes
It swallows me
Is that you there
I twist away
Away
Away
Away


4. Until It Sleeps

Where do I take this pain of mine?
I run, but it stays right by my side

So tear me open, pour me out
There's things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me until it sleeps

Just like the curse, just like the stray
You feed it once and now it stays
Now it stays

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me until I'm clean

It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, so hold me
Until it sleeps (until it sleeps, until it sleeps)

So tell me why you've chosen me
Don't want your grip
Don't want your greed
Don't want it

I'll tear me open, make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me until it sleeps

It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, holds you, holds you
Until it sleeps

I don't want it

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me 'til clean

I'll tear me open, make you gone
No longer will you hurt anyone
And the hate still shapes me
So hold me until it sleeps
Until it sleeps


5. King Nothing

Wish I may, wish I might
Have this I wish tonight
Are you satisfied?
Dig for gold, dig for fame
You dig to make your name
Are you pacified?

All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased

And it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around

Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle's crumbled
And you're left with just a name

Where's your crown, King Nothing?
Where's your crown?

Hot and cold, bought and sold
A heart as hard as gold
Are you satisfied?
Wish I might, wish I may
You wish your life away
Are you pacified?

All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around

Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle's crumbled
And you're left with just a name

Where's your crown, King Nothing?
Yeah, nothing.
Oh, where's your crown?

I wish I may, I wish I might
Have this wish I wish tonight
I want that star, I want it now
I want it all and I don't care how

Careful what you wish
Careful what you say
Careful what you wish, you may regret it
Careful what you wish, you just might get it

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around

Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle's crumbled
And you're left with just a name

Where's your crown, King Nothing?

Nothing

No, you're just nothing
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
No, you're just nothing
Absolutely nothing

Off to Never-Never land


6. Hero Of The Day

Mama, they try and break me

The window burns to light the way back home
A light that warms no matter where they've gone
They're off to find the hero of the day
But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way?

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Do you feel your name?
Did you hear your babies crying?

Mama, they try and break me
Still they try and break me

Excuse me while I tend to how I feel
These things return to me that still seem real
Now, deservingly, this easy chair
But the rocking stopped by wheels of despair

Don't want your aid
But the fist I make
For years can't hold or feel
No, I'm not all me
So please excuse me while I tend to how I feel

But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build the wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can you hear your babies crying now?

[Solo]

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Did you feel your names?
Did you hear your babies crying?

But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build a wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can't you hear your babies crying now?

[2x]
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama they try
Mama they try


7. Bleeding Me

I'm diggin' my way
I'm diggin' my way to something
I'm diggin' my way to somethin' better

I'm pushin' to stay
I'm pushin' to stay with something
I'm pushin' to stay with something better

I'm sowing the seeds
I'm sowing the seeds I've taken
I'm sowing the seeds I take for granted

This thorn in my side
This thorn in my side is from the tree
This thorn in my side is from the tree I've planted

It tears me and I bleed
And I bleed

Caught under wheel's roll
I take the leech I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me
I can't take it
Caught under wheel's roll
The bleeding of me
Of me
The bleeding of me

Caught under wheel's roll
I take the leech I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me
I can't take it
Caught under wheel's roll
The bleeding of me
The bleeding of me

I am the beast that feeds the feast
I am the blood, I am release
Come make me pure
Bleed me a cure
I'm caught, I'm caught, I'm caught under

Caught under wheel's roll
I take that leech I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me
I can't take it, I can't take it, I can't take it
The bleeding of me

Come on
Bleed me

I'm digging my way
I'm digging my way to something
I'm digging my way to something better

I'm pushing to stay
I'm pushing to stay with something
I'm pushing to stay with something better

With something better


8. Cure

The man takes another bullet
He keeps them all within
He must seek no matter how it hurts
So don't fool again

He thinks the answer's cold and in his hand
He takes his medicine
The man takes another bullet
He's been fooled again

Uncross your arms
Take and throw them to the cure, say,
"I do believe."

Uncross your arms now
Take them to it, say
"I do believe."
"I do believe."

The lies tempt her and she follows
Again she lets him in
She must believe to fill the hollow
She's been fooled again

Uncross your arms
Take and throw them to the cure, say
"I do believe."

Uncross your arms now
Take them to it, say,
"I do believe."
"Yeah, I do believe."

Betting on the cure
It must get better than this
Betting on the cure
Everyone's got to have the sickness
'Cause everyone seems to need the cure
Precious cure

Betting on the cure
'Cause it must get better than this
Betting on the cure
Everyone's got to have the sickness
'Cause everyone seems to need the cure
Precious cure

"I do believe."

Betting on the cure
It must get better than this
Need to feel secure
It's got to get better than this
It must get better than this
Betting on the cure
Everyone's got to have the sickness
'Cause everyone seems to need the cure

"I do believe."


9. Poor Twisted Me

Oh, poor twisted me
Oh, poor twisted me
I feast on sympathy
I chew on suffer
I chew on agony

Swallow whole the pain
Oh, it's too good to be
That all this misery
Is just for, oh, poor twisted me
Poor twisted me

Poor mistreated me
Poor mistreated me
I drown without a sea
Lungs fill with sorrow
Lungs fill with misery

Inhaling the deep, dark blue
Oh, woe is me
Such a burden to be
The poor mistreated me

To finally reach the shore, survive the storm
Now you're bare and cold, the sea was warm
So warm, you bathe your soul again

Baby, again and again and again

You finally reached the shore, survived the storm
Now you're bare and cold, the sea was warm
So warm, you bathe your soul again

Good to feel my friend
Oh, woe is me
Such a burden to be
Oh, poor twisted me
Yo, poor twisted me


10. Wasting My Hate

Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you

Ain't gonna waste my hate
Ain't gonna waste my hate on you
I think I'll keep it for myself

Ain't gonna give no more
Ain't got the time to help you score
I think it's time you pleased yourself
Yourself

Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you
Hate

You think you're worthy now?
You think enough to even raise the brow
And to laugh and tip that two-pronged crown?

Well I see my hands, I see my feet
I feel that blood that pumps in beat
But where the hell's my mind going now?
Dead gone now

Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you

Think I'll keep it for myself

Hate

Ain't gonna waste my hate
But I'm so greedy when they say
Better to give than to receive

Ain't gonna waste my hate, no, no
Ain't got time to waste my hate on you
I think I'll keep it all for myself
For myself

Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you

Think I'll keep it for myself, yeah!

Uh, hate


11. Mama Said

Mama, she has taught me well
Told me when I was young,
"Son, your life's an open book.
Don't close it 'fore it's done.
The brightest flame burns quickest."
That's what I heard her say
A son's heart's owed to mother
But I must find my way

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

"Rebel", my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
I left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what is said is done

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave

So let this heart be still

Mama, now I'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
A mother's love for her son
Unspoken, help me be
I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me
I need your arms to welcome me
But a cold stone's all I see

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So let this heart be still

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave

So let this heart be still


12. Thorn Within

Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned
Find me guilty of the life I feel within

When I'm branded,
This mark of shame
Should I look down, disgraced,
Or straight ahead and know that you must blame?

I am the secret
I am the sin
I am the guilty
And I am, I am the thorn within

Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned
Find me guilty when true guilt is from within

So point your fingers,
Point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow you.
One and the same are we

I am the secret
I am the sin
I am the guilty
And I am, I am the thorn within

I do your time, I take your fall
I'm branded guilty for us all

So point your fingers,
Point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow you.
One and the same are we

I am your secrets
I am your sin
I am your guilty
And I am, I am the thorn within

I am the thorn within
I am the thorn within


13. Ronnie

Story starts, quiet town
Small-town boy, big-time frown
Never talks, never plays
Different path, lost his way

Then streets of red... red, I'm afraid...
There's no confetti, no parade
Nothing happens in this boring place
But, oh my God, how it all did change

Now they all pray,
"Blood stain, wash away."

He said,
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way."

I heard it
He said,
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way."

Oh, please wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

I always said something's wrong
With little, strange Ronnie Long
Never laughed, never smiled
Talked alone for miles and miles and miles

"Gallows calls, son," I say
Keep your smile and laugh all day
Think once again in this boring place
For little boys, how they soon change

And they all pray,
"Blood stain, wash away."

He said,
"I lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way."

I heard it
He said,
"I lost my way
This bloody day
I lost my way."

Oh, please wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

Well, all the green things died when Ronnie moved to this place
He said, "Don't you dare ask why I'm cursed to wear this face."
Now we all know why the children called him Ronnie Frown
When he pulled that gun from his pocket they all fall down, down, down

He said,
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way."

Yeah, yeah
I heard it
He screamed,
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way."

Oh, please wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

All things wash away
And they all fall down
But blood stained the sun today

All things wash away
And they all fall down
But blood stained the sun today


14. The Outlaw Torn

And now I wait my whole lifetime for you
And now I wait my whole lifetime for you

I ride the dirt, I ride the tide for you
I search the outside, search inside for you

To take back what you left me
I know I'll always burn to be
The one who seeks so I may find
And now I wait my whole lifetime

Outlaw of torn
Outlaw of torn
And I'm torn

So on I wait my whole lifetime for you
So on I wait my whole lifetime for you

The more I search, the more my need for you
The more I bless, the more I bleed for you

You make me smash the clock and feel
I'd rather die behind the wheel
Time was never on my side
So on I wait my whole lifetime

Outlaw of torn
Outlaw of torn
Outlaw of torn
And I'm torn

Hear me
And if I close my mind in fear
Please pry it open
See me
And if my face becomes sincere
Beware
Hold me
And when I start to come undone
Stitch me together
Save me
And when you see me strut
Remind me of what left this outlaw torn

[Featuring "A National Acrobat"]

I feel so good, I feel so fine
Love that little lady, always on my mind
She gives me love every night and day
Never gonna leave her, never going away

Someone to love me, you know she makes me feel alright!
Someone to need me, love me every single day!

I feel so happy since I met that girl
When we're making love it's something out of this world
It feels so good to know that she's all mine
Gonna love that woman till the end of time

Someone to live for, I'll love her till the end of time!
She makes me feel happy, it's good to know that she's all mine

I am the world that hides
The universal secret of all time
Destruction of the empty spaces
Is my one and only crime
I lived a thousand times
I found out what it means to be believed
The thoughts and images
The unborn child never was conceived
You gotta believe me!
Hey! I'm talkin' to you!
Well, I know it hard for you
To know the reason why
And I know you'll understand
When it's time to die
I don't believe the knife you have
Will be the only one
You have to let your body sleep
To let your soul live on, Ha Ha!!

Feel so happy since I met that girl
When we're making love, it's something out of this world
Feel so good to know that she's all mine
Gonna love that woman till the end of time

Someone to live for, love her till the end of time!
She makes me feel happy, it's good to know she's all mine,
She's all mine, yeah!


4. Turn The Page

[originally by Bob Seger]

On a long and lonesome highway east of Omaha
You can listen to the engines moanin' out his one-note song
You'd think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before

But your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do
When you're riding sixteen hours there's nothing much to do
And you don't feel much like riding, you just wish the trip was through

Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
There I go, playing star again
There I go, turn the page

So you walk into this restaurant, all strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you, as you're shaking off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to explode

Yeah, most times you can't hear 'em talk, other times you can
All the same old clichés: "Is it woman? Is it man?"
And you always seem outnumbered, you don't dare make a stand.
Make your stand.

Now here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playing the star again
There I go, turn the page

Out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy, you try to give away
As the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play, yeah…

Later in the evening, as you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers ringin' in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette, rememberin' what she said
What she said

Yeah!

Yeah, and here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on that stage
And here I go, playing star again
And there I go, turn the page
And there I go, turn that page
There I go, yeah, yeah
There I go, yeah, yeah, yeah

There I go, yeah
Here I go, yeah
There I go
There I go

And I'm gone…

[Originally recorded by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]

There's a devil waiting outside your door
(How much longer?)
There's a devil waiting outside your door
It is bucking and braying and pawing at the floor
And he's howling with pain and crawling up the walls
There's a devil waiting outside your door
He's weak with evil and broken by the world
He's shouting your name and he's asking for more
There's a devil waiting outside your door

There's a devil crawling along your floor
There's a devil crawling along your floor
With a trembling heart, he's coming through your door
With his straining sex in his jumping paw
There's a devil crawling along your floor

7. Mercyful Fate

[Originally recorded by Mercyful Fate]

[Featuring: "Evil," "Curse of the Pharaohs," "Satan's Fall,"]
["A Corpse Without Soul," and "Into the Coven."]

Satan's Fall
They're walking by the night
The moon has frozen blue
Long black coats a shelter for the rain
Their load must get through
Now bats are leaving their trees
They're joining the call
Seven satanic Hell preachers
Heading for the hall
Bringing the blood of a newborn child
Got to succeed, if not it's Satan's fall

Curse Of The Pharaohs
Away out in Egypt in the valley of kings
Where the mummified pharaohs
Pretend dead in their sleep
Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you
The curse of the pharaohs can be so deadly
Just destroying your future
Makin' it all shady
Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you

A Corpse Without Soul
Listen, I'm a corpse, I'm a corpse
I'm a corpse without soul
Satan, he's taken, he's taken
He's taken his toll
And he took it on me
I, I'm trapped, I'm trapped
I'm trapped in his spell
Tonight, I'm going, I'm going
I'm going to Hell, inside his spell

Into The Coven
Howl like a wolf
And a witch will open the door
Follow me and meet our high priestess
Come, come into my coven
And become Lucifer's child
Undress until you're naked
And put on this white coat
Take this white cross and go to the center of the ring
Come, come into my coven
And become Lucifer's child

Evil
I was born on the cemetery
Under the sign of the moon
Raised from my grave by the dead
And I was made a mercenary
In the legions of Hell
Now I'm king of pain, I'm insane
You know my only pleasure
Is to hear you cry
I'd love to hear you cry
I'd love to see you die
And I'll be the first
To watch your funeral
And I'll be the last to leave
I'd love to hear you cry
And when you're down beyond the ground
I'll dig up your body again
And make love to shame
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye
You've gotta say goodbye
'Cause I will eat your mind


8. Astronomy

[Originally recorded by Blue Oyster Cult]

Clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Like acid and oil on a madman's face
His reason tends to fly away
Like lesser birds on the four winds
Like silver scrapes in May
And now the sand's become a crust
Most of you have gone away

Come Susie dear, let's take a walk
Just out there upon the beach
I know you'll soon be married
And you'll want to know where winds come from
Well it's never said at all
On the map that Carrie reads
Behind the clock back there you know
At the Four Winds Bar

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Four winds at the Four Winds Bar
Two doors locked and windows barred
One door left to take you in
The other one just mirrors it

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Hellish glare and inference
The other one's a duplicate
The Queenly flux, eternal light
Or the light that never warms
Yes the light that never, never warms
Or the light that never
Never warms
Never warms
Never warms

The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Miss Carrie nurse and Susie dear
Would find themselves at Four Winds Bar

It's the nexus of the crisis
And the origin of storms
Just the place to hopelessly
Encounter time and then came me

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Call me Desdinova
Eternal light
These gravely digs of mine
Will surely prove a sight
And don't forget my dog
Fixed and consequent

Astronomy...a star

[originally by The Dubliners]

As I was goin' over the Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell and his money he was countin'
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier
I said, "Stand and deliver, oh, or the devil he may take ya."

Train roll on, on down the line
Won't you please take me far away
Now, I feel the wind blow outside my door
I leave my woman at home

Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind

I've gotta see you moving fast, see you come my way.
See the dreams, I hope they last, never fade away.

Look out at the darkness, and you will see.
Just call my name and I'll be there.
You cannot touch me, you would not dare.
I am the chill that's in the air.

And I try to get through to you, in my own special way,
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day.

Dark rivers are flowing back into the past.
You are the fish for which I cast.
And what of the future, what is to be.
As the rivers flow into the sea.

And I try to get through to you, in my own special way,
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day.

Do not take for granted, powers out there.
Don't step into the demon's lair.
Time is an illusion, rising from time.
Steep is the mountain which we climb.

And I try to get through to you, in my own special way,
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day.


14. The Wait

[Original: Killing Joke]

Motives changing, day to day,
The fire increases, masks decay.
I look at the river, white foam floats down,
The body's poisoned, gotta sit tight.

The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait.

After wakening, silence grows,
The screams subside, distortion shows.
Mutant thoughts of bad mouthed news,
Is just another birth of distorted views.

The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait.

The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait.

Show to me in surgery,

You did your best as someone could,
I bet you never knew you would,
And did you run away from me,
I bet you thought you really could.
You've come to this as someone told,
I bet you never knew you would.
Gonna bring green hell, green hell.


17. Am I Evil?

[Original: Diamond Head]

My mother was a witch, she was burned alive.
Thankless little bitch, for the tears I cried.
Take her down now, don't want to see her face
All blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace.

Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
See their bodies out on the ice.
Take my time.

Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.

As I watched my mother die, I lost my head.
Revenge now I sought, to break with my bread.
Taking no chances, you come with me.
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free.

Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
See their bodies out on the ice.
Take my time.

Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.

On with the action now, I'll strip your pride.
I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride.
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat.
Like a double dozen before ya, smells so sweet.

Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.

I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire.
You can come with me, sweet desire.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.

Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.

My soul is longing for, await my heir.
Sent to avenge my mother, sweep myself.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.

Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.

Am I evil? Yes I fucking am.
Am I evil? I am man, yeah.


18. Blitzkrieg

[Original: Blitzkrieg]

Let us have peace, let us have life,
Let us escape the cruel night.
Let us have time, let the sun shine,
Let us beware the deadly sign.

The day is coming, Armageddon's near,
Inferno's coming, can we survive the blitzkrieg.
The blitzkrieg, the blitzkrieg.

Save us from fate, save us from hate,
Save ourselves before it's too late.
Come to our need, hear our plea,
Save ourselves before the earth bleeds.

The day is dawning, the time is near,
Aliens calling, can we survive the blitzkrieg.


19. Breadfan

[Original: Budgie]

Breadfan, open up your mind, open up your purse,
Open up your bones, never, never gonna lose it.
Breadfan, take it all away, never give an inch,
Gotta make a mint, gotta make me a million.
Breadfan, you got it wrong, some long time friend's
Gonna lose it in the end, who's a fool.
Seagull, give it all away, stay a bird, stay a man,
Stay a ghost, stay what you wanna be.

Loser, give it all away, never stay with the winner,
With the man with all the filthy money.
Come on, keep it on the side, with a ride on a record,
On the top if you're gonna be a bad boy.
Breadfan, you got it wrong, some long time friend's
Gonna lose it in the end, who's a fool.
Seagull, give it all away, stay a bird, stay a man,
Stay a ghost, stay what you wanna be.

Breadfan, open up your mind, open up your purse,
Open up your bones, never, never gonna lose it.
Breadfan, take it all away, never give an inch,
Gotta make a mint, gotta make me a million.
Breadfan, you got it wrong, some long time friend's
Gonna lose it in the end, who's a fool.
Seagull, give it all away, stay a bird, stay a man,
Stay a ghost, stay what you wanna be.


20. The Prince

[Original: Diamond Head]

Now I see his face, I see his smile.
Such a lonely place, no golden mile.
Eyes tell of morbid tales, of his black heart.
His deeds through ages past tell of his part.

See his face, see his smile.
Time to die, o-oh, no-oh, no-oh.

Angel from below, change my dreams.
I want for glory's hour, for wealth's esteem.
I wish to sell my soul, to be reborn.
I wish for earthly riches, don't want no crown of thorns.

See his face, see his smile.
Time to die, o-oh, o-oh, no-oh.

I was born a fool, don't want to stay that way.
Devil take my soul, with diamonds you repay.
I don't care for heaven, so don't you look for me to cry.
And I will burn in hell, from the day I die.

See his face, see his smile.
Time to die, o-oh, no-oh, no.


21. Stone Cold Crazy

[Original: Queen]

Sleeping very soundly on a Saturday morning,
I was dreaming I was Al Capone.
Rumours going round, gotta clear out of town,
Smell like a dry fishbone.
Here come the law, gonna break down the door,
Carry me away once more.
Never, never, never want it anymore,
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor.
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know.

Rainy afternoon, ought to kill a typhoon,
And she's playing on my slide trombone.
Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore,
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor.
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know.

Walking down the street, shooting people that I meet,
Fully loaded Tommy gun.
Here come the deputy, try fucking getting me,
Gotta fucking get up and run.
They got the sirens loose, I ran right out of juice.
They're gonna put me in a cell,
If I can't go to heaven, let me go to hell.
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know, yeah.


22. So What

[Original: Anti Nowhere League]

So fucking what!

Well, I've been to Hastings and I've been to Brighton,
I've been to Eastbourne too.
So what, so what.
And I've been here, I've been there,
I've been every fucking where.

So fucking what! Yeah!


23. Killing Time

[Original: Sweet Savage]

Sound of gunfire comes through the night,
Killing and hatred, it's a terrible sight.
Reports come in of the heavy attack,
Message is seen, we're moving back.

Preparations are made for the journey back,
It's a survival, supplies are packed.
No more nights in this eternal hell,
Destination is simple, we move out.

Killing time - You left from the line.
Killing time - Your turn to kill.
Killing time - What do you say?
Killing time - Aaha, killing time.

And he knew what he needed to keep us alive,
No time for cowardice, kill and survive.
Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife,
Nasty word, he'll take your life.

The silence is over, they attack again,
Killing and hatred drive me insane.
Reports come in of a heavy attack,
Message is seen, we're moving back.

Killing time - You left from the line.
Killing time - Your turn to kill.
Killing time - What do you say?
Killing time - Aaha, killing time.

Sound of gunfire comes through the night,
Killing and hatred, it's a terrible sight.
Reports come in of a heavy attack,
Message is seen, we're moving back.

And he knew what he needed to keep us alive,
No time for cowardice, kill and survive.
Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife,
Nasty word, he'll take your life.

Killing time - You left from the line.
Killing time - Your turn to kill.
Killing time - What do you say?
Killing time - Aaha, killing time.


24. Overkill

[Kilmister, Clarke, Taylor]
[Originally recorded by Motorhead in 1979]

Only way to feel the noise
Is when it's good and loud
So good I can't believe it
Screamin' with the crowd

Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Don't sweat it

25. Damage Case

[Originally recorded by Motorhead in 1979]

Hey babe don't act so scared
All I want is some special care
On the run from some institution
All I want is some constellation

And I can tell by his face
I'm a total disgrace
Put me inside this place
Move over for a damage case

Hey baby wait a minute, stop
Don't run away, don't call a cop
I Ain't lookin' to victimize you
All I want to do is tantalize you

I can tell by your face
Got no time for a damage case

No time baby!

Hey babe don't turn away

I don't care if you want your name is

And I can tell by this face
You're all over the place
I can tell by his face
Move over for a damage case
Get the fuck over man!

All right


26. Stone Dead Forever

[Originally recorded by Motorhead in 1979]

Get on!

You think you see me
In the glass
You think you hear me
Better listen fast
I think I see you
Gone to seed
Think your reason
Is your guilt and greed

You're out there on your own
Your face turned to stone
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever
All right

You're a financial wizard
Yeah a top tycoon
You're Sweet long lizard
With a silver spoon
You know you've never had it
Quite so good
And you didn't know
That you even could

Your time has come to own
Your touch turned to gold
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever
All right

Financial wizard
A top tycoon
Sweet lounge lizard
With a silver spoon
You've never had it
Quite so good
And you didn't know
That you even could

But your time has turned to gold
Your touch is turned to gold
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever

It's been a long time
It's been a long long wait
And you caught your fingers
In the pearly gates
You better leave your number
And we'll call you
You know your problem
Ain't exactly new

Your time has come today
Your face has turned to hey
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever
That's right

Yo

Ah


27. Too Late Too Late

[Originally recorded by Motorhead]

Huh

I see that nothing's changed
Insist on playing games
Some waste of time you are
And you're so popular
Well this is it you bitch
I've got to make my switch
I'm just another john
I know what's goin' on

Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
No-oh, too late, too late

I thought you was for real
But you're a rip-off deal
Don't give me all that crap
I just escaped your trap
I think you see the joke
But you're just chasin' smoke
You ain't another one
I know what's goin' on

Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
Hello, too late, too late
Oh

Get on it!

Misunderstanding me
The way you feel so free
I'm gonna jump the gun
Oh I'm gonna hit an' run
Your credibility
Don't cut no ice with me
Another privilege gone
I know what's goin' on

Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
Oh oh, too late, too late
Oh, too late, too late

1. Cowboys From Hell

Under the lights where we stand tall
Nobody touches us at all
Showdown, shootout, spread fear within, without
We're gonna take what's ours to have
Spread the word throughout the land
They say the bad guys wear black
We're tagged and can't turn back

You see us comin'
And you all together run for cover
We're taking over this town

Here we come reach for your gun
And you better listen well my friend, you see
It's a pistol is down below aimed at you
We're the cowboys from hell.

Aimed at you we're the cowboys from hell
Deed is done again, we've won
Ain't talking no tall tales friend
'Cause high noon, your doom
Comin' for you we're the cowboys from hell

Pillage the village, trash the scene
But better not take it out on me
'Cause a ghost town is found
Where your city used to be
So out of the darkness and into the light
Sparks fly everywhere in sight
From my double barrel, 12 gauge,
Can't lock me in your cage

You see us comin'
And you all together run for cover
We're taking over this town

Here we come reach for your gun
And you better listen well my friend, you see
It's a pistol is down below aimed at you
We're the cowboys from hell.
Deed is done again, we've won
Ain't talking no tall tales friend
'Cause high noon, your doom
Comin' for you we're the cowboys from hell


2. Primal Concrete Sledge

There's a double standard for the way we live
If there's nothing to have, well then there's nothing to save
I'll break a sweat and I don't regret
What you'd kill to see brings out the god in me.

Come and be with me
Live my twisted dream
Pro devoted pledge
Time for primal concrete sledge

The man of a thousand retirements
Will always be the one to tell you when to quit
I won't take stock in a withered man
I'm reaching into you, I'll make you understand

Come and be with me
Live my twisted dream
Pro devoted pledge
Time for primal concrete sledge


3. Psycho Holiday

Empty and sweating
Head lying in your hands
Shaking in the corner
Done too much alcohol
Gotta get away from it all
'Cause it feels my blood is freezing
My self insanity has taken its toll
Frustration has taken its control

Now I'm far from home
Spending time alone
It's time to set my demons free
Been put to the test
My mind laid to rest
I'm on a psycho holiday

Shot down on sight
You are the target of attention
One woman here another there
You can't please all the people all the time
Can't tell the strangers
From the friends you know
Frustration has taken it's control

Now you're far from home
Spending time alone
It's time to set your demons free
Been put through the test
Your mind laid to rest
You're on a psycho holiday

I'm strapped in for life
Is this where I lived
Or where I died
You want my money
You take my space
My mind is telling me
To leave this place
My self insanity has taken its toll
Frustration has taken its control

Now you're far from home
Spending time alone
It's time to set your demons free
Been put through the test
Your mind laid to rest
You're on a psycho holiday


4. Heresy

Here we are
In a world of corruption
Human nature is
Of violent Breed
Who cares if there's no tomorrow
When I die for my future's
Laid out for me
Can't you see?
Rise above the lies
Morals on a backwards globe
A sin to you
For me it's hope.

It's my life and provision
Black or white
Some pay to pray
You question why they
Act this way
It's their fucking decision

No more judgement day
Only tranquility
Peace signs, protest lines
Mean nothing to me

Honesty born in me
Heresy

I know what's right or wrong
And my belief is stronger
Than your advice
People, they go to war
Because religion gives them
Reason to fight
Sacrifice, die for pride
A group that caters
No one's fees
Or synthetic deities
Is where I belong
My stand is the human race
Without a label or a face
So they can lick my sack

No more judgement day
Only tranquility
Peace signs, protest lines
Mean nothing to me

Honesty born in me
Heresy


5. Cemetery Gates

Reverend reverend is this some conspiracy?
Crucified for no sins
An image beneath me
Whats within our plans for life
It all seems so unreal
I'm a man cut in half in this world
Left in my misery...

The reverend he turned to me
Without a tear in his eyes
It's nothing new for him to see
I didn't ask him why
I will remember
The love our souls had
Sworn to make
Now I watch the falling rain
All my mind can see
Now is your (face)

Well I guess
You took my youth
I gave it all away
Like the birth of a
New-found joy
This love would end in rage
And when she died
I couldn't cry
The pride within my soul
You left me incomplete
All alone as the
Memories now unfold.

Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the
Cemetery gates

Sometimes when I'm alone
I wonder aloud
If you're watching over me
Some place far abound
I must reverse my life
I can't live in the past
Then set my soul free
Belong to me at last

Through all those
Complex years
I thought I was alone
I didn't care to look around
And make this world my own
And when she died
I should've cried and spared myself some pain...
Left me incomplete
All alone as the memories still remain

The way we were
The chance to save my soul
And my concern is now in vain
Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates


6. Domination

Agony is the price
That you'll pay in the end
Domination consumes you
Then calls you a friend
It's a twisted fall
Binds are like steel
And manipulates the will to be
And it's hard to see
How soon we forget
When there's nothing else
Left to destroy
It's a useless ploy

Your eyes will see
The dawn of the day
And the writing
On the wall
Those words that stare
Into your soul
And to yourself
You will befall

It's domination pushed into living hell
Domination a now blacked heart
Is reaching out divinity
Body suspended by chains over razors
And nails it's a penalty
Each razor a vice and each nail
Marks the demise of your life.
Grim construction grows
Has life played a trick
Sealed you in brick by brick
'Til your end forcing you to bend

Your eyes will see
The dawn of the day
And the writing
On the wall
Those words that stare
Into your soul
And to yourself
You will befall

It's domination pushed into living hell
Domination a now blacked heart
Is reaching out divinity
Body suspended by chains over razors
And nails it's a penalty
Each razor a vice and each nail
Marks the demise of your life.
Grim construction grows
Has life played a trick
Sealed you in brick by brick
'Til your end forcing you to bend


7. Shattered

It's storming broken glass, corpses left in piles
Ungracious bludgeonmnet that breaks the earth for miles
Nothing can stop it, the day has come, from below it's catastrophic

Freezing, there's no healing families are dying

This world is shattered... all shattered

Life crushing turbulence, this wrath can't be denied
Wishing you could help your friends, standing where they died
Echoes haunting, a hollow planet, lacerations, dissected nation

Freezing, there's no healing everyone is dying

This world is shattered... all shattered


8. Clash With Reality

Sometimes I know
I feel untouchable
Drowning in life
Caught up in the accessible
Back down the ground
I hear the sound
there's no escape
The concrete cloud
Spilling on me
Drenching me with
Laymen's sins
I hear the sirens
From the back of me
I'm crashing face first
Into the glass eye

Clash with reality
It rears it's ugly head
Clash with reality
The indescribable
Let the dogs lie
Where we sleep
Irrelevant theme

A situation and there's
Nothing but right
In kicks the door
Nobody moves
'Cause in walks the problem
Dictates your fate
Evicts, convicts
Who'll sign the writ of life?
This now becomes
Their morbid game
Who's piss poor excuse
Is this for a world?
It swells my hatred
Day by day

Clash with reality
It rears it's ugly head
Clash with reality
The indescribable
Let the dogs lie
Where we sleep
Irrelevant theme


9. Medicine Man

Many distant miles away
Past the shores of ever dark
There stays a magic man
Who bears an evil mark
He helps all concerned
Those who come again return
Injecting lies while fires burn
The devil's heart
With angel's words
Have you wondered
What heaven's like?
He can show you in one night
Overwhelming with euphoric lift
To lure you to steal your gift

Intoxication
Seeping down to the bone
And there's no question
Where you have to go

Understand just take his hand
He's the medicine man

Once proud and fearless men
With desire in their eyes
Lost strong and fruitful lives
To self-indulgent ties
Their souls were dipped in venom
And put into a box
Then placed upon a crowded shelf
Where countless souls now rot
Have you ever wondered what hell's like?
He can take you there
Just one taste and you'll be back
And by the high you'll swear

Intoxication
Seeping down to the bone
And there's no question
Where you have to go

Understand just take his hand
He's the medicine man


10. Message In Blood

There's a place that I keep deep inside me
It can trigger my mind
All along I knew it has been with me
Since I was just a child

I just summon power within my soul
It has given me life, beyond life I take
Blame for my murderous problem my signature
Always reminds

It's a message in blood
It's your cryptic warning
Within the message in blood
Marks the years of pain,
And your godforsaken ending to life

I'm provoked into sick confrontations, brutal
Time after time, bed of nails, suffocation,
life's ending, slay in different designs
One mans misery is another mans mystery
No one cares to understand my
Demented means
Sticks and stones can break all your
brittle bones, epitaph written at your feet

It's a message in blood
It's your cryptic warning
Within the message in blood
Marks the years of pain,
And your godforsaken ending to life


11. The Sleep

Understanding what has
Happened before us
We are confined to a
Darkened hidden tomb
The conquering of our world
As we knew it
Rise above this pit
Of sorrow and pain
Among the few
We are the avant leaders
We've got to live
Through this trouble and decay

This question haunts my mind
Will we survive this night?
We're harboring the meek
Will we survive the sleep?

Unsure and scared
We are planning our reprise
Revolves around this world
We don't know anymore
The odds against us
Yet we're stronger and prevailing
Learn from mistakes
Counting souls for sale

This question haunts my mind
Will we survive this night?
We're harboring the meek
Will we survive the sleep?


12. The Art Of Shredding

Unity is a rare thing
Blind eyes of society bring
The category of minority
Now what are we supposed to be?
Born free to be
Powerless to change the world
With our lives in the hands of madmen

Now in times when society needs us
This is where the sin begins
We're aware they're going to free us
Rage from our hearts within
Born of this world
Which is a living hell
But we'll be closer to heaven

So now, this is the art
To shred... it's only emotion

1. Mouth For War

Revenge
I'm screaming revenge again
Wrong
I've been wrong for far too long
Been constantly so frustrated
I've moved mountains with less
When I channel my hate to productive
I don't find it hard to impress

[Pre]
Bones in traction
Hands break to hone raw energy
Bold and disastrous
My ears can't hear what you say to me

[Chorus]
Hold your mouth for the war
Use it for what it's for
Speak the truth about me
Determined

Possessed
I feel a conquering will down inside me
Strength
The strength of many to crush
Who might stop me
My strength is in number
And my soul lies in every one
The releasing of anger can better any medicine under the sun

[Pre]

[Chorus]

There comes a time within everyone to close your eyes to what's real
No comprehension to fail
I vacuum the wind for my sail
Can't be the rest
Let others waste my time
Owning success is the bottom line.
Like a knife into flesh
After life is to death
Pulling and punching the rest of duration
NO ONE can piss on this determination


2. A New Level

Now a new look in my eyes my spirit rise
Forget the past
Present tense works and lasts
Got shit on
Pissed on
Spit on
Stepped on
Fucked with
Pointed at by lesser men

[Pre]
New life in place of old life
Unscarred by trials

[Chorus]
A new level of confidence and power

Demanding plea for unity between us all --
United stand
Death before divided fall
In mock military order
Vulgar
Power
Impatient
Because time is shorter

[Pre]

[Chorus]

No fucking surrender
Can't lose
Life kills


3. Walk

Can't you see I'm easily bothered by persistence
One step from lashing out at you...
You want in to get under my skin
And call yourself a friend
I've got more friends like you
What do I do?

[Pre:]
Is there no standard anymore?
What it takes, who I am, where I've been belong
You can't be something you're not
Be yourself, by yourself
Stay away from me
A lesson learned in life
Known from the dawn of time

[Chorus:]
Respect, walk, what did you say?
Respect, walk, are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me?

Run your mouth when I'm not around, it's easy to achieve
You cry to weak friends that sympathize
Can you hear the violins playing your song?
Those same friends tell me your every word

[Pre]

[Chorus:]
Respect, walk, what did you say?
Respect, walk, are you talking to me?
Respect, walk, what did you say?
Respect, walk, are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me?

No way punk!

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Respect, walk, what did you say?
Respect, walk, are you talking to me?
Respect, walk, what did you say?
Respect, walk, are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me?

Walk on home, boy!


4. Fucking Hostile

Almost every day
I see the same face
On broken picture tube
It fits the attitude
If you could see yourself
You put you on a shelf
Your verbal masturbate
Promise to nauseate
Today I'll play the part of non-parent
Not make a hundred rules
For you to know about yourself
Not lie and make you believe
What's evil is making love
and making friends
and meeting God you're own way
The right way

[Chorus]
To see
To bleed
Cannot be taught
In turn
You're making us
Fucking hostile

We stand alone

The truth in right and wrong
The boundaries of the law
You seem to miss the point
Arresting for a joint?
You seem to wonder why
Hundreds of people die
You're writing tickets man
My mom got jumped -- they ran!
Now I'll play a public servant
To serve and protect
By the law and the state
I'd bust the punks
That rape steal and murder
And leave you be
If you crossed me
I'd shake your hand like a man
Not a god

[Chorus]

Come meet your maker, boy
Some things you can't enjoy
Because of heaven/hell
A fucking wives' tale
They put it in your head
Then put you in your bed
He's watching say your prayers
Cause God is everywhere
Now I'll play a man learning priesthood
Who's about to take the ultimate test in life
I'd question things because I am human
And call NO ONE my father who's no closer that a stranger

I won't listen

[Chorus]


5. This Love

If ever words were spoken
Painful and untrue
I said I loved but I lied
In my life
All I wanted
Was the keeping
Of someone like you
As it turns out
Deeper within me
Love was twisted and pointed at you

Never ending pain, quickly ending life --

[Chorus]
You keep this love, thing, love, child, love, toy
You keep this love, fist, love, scar, love, break
You keep this love

I'd been the tempting one
Stole her from herself
This gift in pain
Her pain was life
And sometimes I feel so sorry
I regret this the hurting of you
But you make me so unhappy
I'd take my life and leave love with you

I'd kill myself for you, I'd kill you for myself --

[Chorus]

No more head trips


6. Rise

We've got no time to lose
Your news is old news
Hate this, hate me, hate this
Right approach for the wrong
It's time to spread the word
Let the voice be heard
All of us, one of us, all of us
Dominate and take the motherfucking world

Mass prediction, unification
Breathing life into our lungs
EVERY creed and EVERY kind
To give us depth for strength

Taught when we're young to hate one another
It's time to have a new reign of power
Make pride universal so no one gives in
Turn our backs on those who oppose
Then when confronted we ask them the question
What's wrong with their mind?
What's wrong with your mind?

[Chorus]
It's time to RISE

We've lived with past mistakes
And we've lived with our own
Forgive, forget forgive
Be a man, not a child
There are to tears for peace
Of the common sympathies
Educate, reinstate, educate
A thing of past
The trouble in the states

It's time to rise


7. No Good (Attack The Radical)

In the states
There's a problem with race
Because of ignorant past burned fires
From evolution
We've been killing each other
I figure man should have it down to a science

No chance
Not for a minute
Not for a second
I won't be defensive
I'm straight out in my opinion
You'd better listen to a man who knows what he is saying
I've seen your side
You run and hide for the mere fact that you feel inferior
Be superior
And know your interior

[Pre]
Race, pride, prejudice
Black man, white man
No stand
Live in the past
We make it last
A hated mass
No solution
Mind pollution
For revolution

[Chorus]
So low behold my eyes
This land of fools will rise
No good
For no one

You blame oppression and play the role of criminals
To rape and burn show progress is minimal
White hoods and militants you know it's such a pity
Living, breathing
Violence in your city

If one man
Had one home
In one world
Held live alone without variety
Full of anxiety
No one to point at, question
Or even talk to -- in his private grave
No matter what color
He wouldn't be saved from hell
He dwells
A closed mind playing the part of prison cells

[Pre]

[Chorus]


8. Live In A Hole

Full of grief I scream at the wind
Thought I heard the words of others
Imprison myself
And stay in a shell
I won't let you in to have a story to tell
Things tend to drag me down
Don't understand so they hate me now

[Chorus]
My fear grips the will of stone
My grip fears I'll die alone

I promised myself somewhere in the teenage life
I'd never submit to the ones I will not be like
Live in a hole
But stay close to my kind
Cause they understand what burns in my mind
I still feel incomplete
Friends are few and far between

[Chorus]


9. Regular People (Conceit)

I've trampled on that road
That you think you own
You have that "smart ass" attitude
It's time to stop the fiction

I live it every day
While your mind's far away
I'm out here putting pride on the line
And you case on me with pure respect
One chance at one thing
Hard time is coming
My time, your pain
I reign on you

[Pre]
You think you own
I take away
Take it with me
You think you own
I took away
Made it my own

[Chorus]
Most regular people would say it's hard
And any streetwise son of a bitch knows
Don't fuck with this

The so many times
You practice in your mirror
To be just like me
But you just can't see
You ain't got the balls, son

I fight for love of brother
Your friends fight one another
You can't see because your head's up your ass
And just in case you think you're bad
I crush your rush
I rule YOU fool
I'm immovable stone in your world of weak -- I speak

[Pre]

[Chorus]


10. By Demons Be Driven

Serving the faith
Abduction the oath
It lie in wait for the offering
Religion is old
For drawing the young
Purity withers and dies
Never return to the ones that provided
Children draining parents of will
I hold out my hand to bloodless child
I'm taken by the one I was saving
From death

[Chorus]
By demons be driven
Beckon the call

With decline in mind
End not far
We're left hanging alone here
He pulls us from nails
Shatters our bones
Leaving us crippled and strewn
Boiling my corpse in the blood of his children
Praying for his god to prevail
Burying us with loved ones
To sleep with shelled children of the sixth dimension

[Chorus]


11. Hollow

What's left inside him?
Don't he remember us?
Can't he believe me?
We seemed like brothers
Talked for hours last month
About what we wanna be
I sit now with his hand in mine
But I know he can't feel...

No one knows
What's done is done
It's as if he were dead

I'm close with his mother
And she cries endlessly
Lord how we miss him
At least what's remembered
It's so important to make best friends in life
But it's hard when my friend sits with blank expressions

No one knows
What's done is done
It's as if he were dead

He as hollow as I alone now
He as hollow as I alone
A shell of my friend
Just flesh and bone
There's no soul
He sees no love
I shake my fists at skies above
Mad at God

He as hollow as I converse
I wish he'd waken from this curse
Hear my words before it's through
I want to come in after you
My best friend

He as hollow as I alone

1. Strength Beyond Strength

There is nothing.
No education.
No family life to open my arms to.
You'd say that my job is today, yet gone tomorrow.
I'll be broke in a gutter.

I know the opinion.
A broken record.
Fuck you and your college dream.
Fact is we're stronger than all.

You're working for perfect bodies,
perfect minds and perfect neighbors.
But I'm helping to legalize dope on your pristine streets
and I'm making a fortune.

You're muscle and gall.
Naive at best.
I'm bone, brain and cock.
Deep down stronger than all.

A sad state of affairs.
A crippled America.
A pipe dream buttfucked.
Immune. Stronger than all.

A lament for a rookie officer, punk ass weak little lamb.
For the mob, truly, does rule at this particular time.

We've grown into a monster.
An arrogant, explosive motherfuck.
Hard as a rock. Shut like a lock.
Finally, the president in submission.
He holds out his hand on your television and draws back a stump.
It's too late for some, far too late.

No more holdbacks. No more paying a cops paycheck.
Let him bust his own child.
The son that heeds my word and smokes my dope.
The daughter that sucks me off and snorts cheap anything.

Hail Kings.
The new Kings.
Stronger than all.

A simple process to legalize.
There would not be a choice but to take our side.
Be there no question of certain strengths.
Know this intention.
Forever stronger than all.


2. Becoming

A long time ago I never knew myself.
Then the memory of shame birthed its gift.

No more. The small one, the weak one, the frightened one.
Running from beatings, deflating.
I'm becoming more than a man.
More than you ever were.
Driven and burning to rise beyond Jesus.

I'm born again with snakes eyes
Becoming Godsize

I found my life was slipping through my hands.
Perhaps through death my life won't be so bad.

I can see you, can fuck you, inside of you.
Staring through your eyes.
Belittle your friends to serve me, to suck me,
To realize my saving grasp.
I of suicide.
I the unlord.

I'm born again with snakes eyes
Becoming Godsize


3. 5 Minutes Alone

I see you had your mind all made up
you group of pitiful liars.
Before I woke to face the day,
your master plan transpired.
Something told me
this job had more to meet the eye.
My song is not believed?
My words somewhat deceiving?
Now I'm unwhole.

[bridge:]
You've waged a war of nerves
But you can't crush the kingdom
Can't be what your idols are.
Can't leave the scar.
You cry for compensation.
I ask you please just give us...

[chorus:]
5 minutes alone

I read your eyes, your mind was made up.
You took me for a fool.
You used complexion of my skin
for a counter racist tool.
You can't burn me
I've spilled my guts out in the past.
Taken advantage of
because you know where I've come.
My past.

[bridge]

[chorus]

[solo]

[chorus]

I ask you please just give us


4. I'm Broken

I wonder if we'll smile in our coffins
while loved ones mourn the day,
the absence of our faces,
living, laughing, eyes awake.
Is this too much for them to take?

Too young for one's conclusion, the lifestyle won.
Such values you taught your son.
That's how.

Look at me now.
I'm broken.
Inherit my life.

One day we all will die, a cliched fact of life.
Force fed to make us heed.
Inbred to sponge our bleed.
Every warning, a leaking rubber,
a poison apple for mingled blood.

Too young for one's delusion the lifestyle cost
Venereal Mother embrace the loss.
That's how

Look at you now.
You're broken
Inherit your life.


5. Good Friends And A Bottle Of Pills

I fucked your girlfriend last night.
While you snored and drooled, I fucked your love.
She called me Daddy.
And I called her baby when I smacked her ass.
I called her sugar when I ate her alive till daylight.
And I slept with her all over me,
from forehead to ribcage I dripped her ass.
Sometimes I thought you might be spying,
living out some brash fantasy, but no.
You were knocked out.
But we were all knocked out you know.
In a way

I serve too many masters.

We didn't know you'd break the bottle
that the magic came in to use those jagged shards
to cut our wrists and neck.
And you'd do it too, you're that kind of dude.
But you wouldn't know what you were doing
because I didn't,
your girlfriend could have been a burn victim,
an amputee, a dead body.
But god damn I wanted to fuck.

I'm losing what's left of my fucking mind,
I serve too many fucking masters.

(I told you. I told you motherfucker)


6. Hard Lines, Sunken Cheeks

As a child I was given the gift to entertain you.
But through blood I inherited a life that could destroy you.

I drink all day. I smoke all day.
I took your daughters breath away.
I've done it all but tap the vein.
These hard lines and sunken cheeks are text book reasons
All these Christians come alive and try to sell you

My soul for a goat, yet I'll outlive the old.

You know it's bad, some may say sad,
a hangover is inspiration.
Like a junkie I hurt for it.
A bad trip, the emptiness.

I never sleep, or always sleep
a lack of fulfillment to me is me.
The big picture.
These hard lines and sunken cheeks
are part of what the Christians mean
to immortalize my situation.

My soul for a goat. Yet I'll outlive the old.

Embrace some religion.
To get close to some undivine ejaculation point.
Simply to thy ghost I cling.
Simply to thy ghost I reject.
Simply to thy ghost I give spit.

Tempter, tempting, tempt me. Molest me.
You know that I'll submit.
For this is my weakness
and it saves me from relationships
With those Christians you know they'll sell you

my soul for a goat. Yet I'll outlive the old.


7. Slaughtered

One's own Kingman,
Christ person, Woman God.
At battle with a mass astrengent.
The bond that blends the weak to the wise.

It's a safe assumption
that you'd want to save me now.
But I'll never face castration.
For your sacred sow is left

slaughtered.

Brainwashed by me.
Myself influence I.
Bird brained
World saver.
A fake god rests dead inside you.

It's a safe assumption
that you'd want to save me now.
But I'll never face castration.
For your sacred sow is left

Slaughtered.

System destroyed. Exposed and unployed.
The fruit of intention
cry for their dead, but turning their head
to ignore reality's claw.
Knife to your wrist, syringe in your arm
is your ounce of prevention.
Give what you made,
And under your name on your grave, is salvation.

A big fucking joke.

Slaughter the pig, the self righteous king
for your own restoration.
God is in your chest and faith kills what is precious,
for death is unanswered.

Slaughtered.

Do sin [x4]


8. 25 Years

I vent my frustration at you old man,
after years your ears will hear.

You screamed you tried,
it's words of a weakling
and promises made by a liar, drunken liar.

Now you pick up that splintered chair,
that was aiming for your head.

A head that should have been long ago kicked in by me.
Alone.

I won't lose a second of sleep for this...

Don't touch me.
No!
Ever again
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Don't touch me

Orphaned to the dope and drinks,
I learned my lesson well, somehow from you.

No tears. Can't clutch my regrets.
But these years of detachment
have left me with demons now surfacing.
I'm becoming more than nothing.

You never knew the answers to any of my questions, did you?
You made up all the answers to my unimportant existence.

But now you don't have to dump me off,

Not again
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Fuck, no!

Ever again
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Fuck, no!
Don't touch me
Never again

I vow, lest I die tomorrow...

You'll never be the father I am.
The bastard father to the thousands
of the ugly, criticized, the unwanted.
The ones with fathers just like you.
We're fucking you back.

I'm shoving my life right down your throat.
Can I find the guts?
Can I feel the heart?
Look at the ground as you choke me up,
does it taste like tequila?
Or failure?

We're fucking you back
Fucking you back
We're fucking you back
Fucking you back


9. Shedding Skin

I don't want you to look at me while
I'm shedding skin.
I can't afford for you to see what's in.
I'd rather shoot myself than have you watch me.
I feel you'd steal my skin to try and wear me.

I was betrayed, one more day of my short life.
You were carried away. You had no shame.
To suffocate my being.
I was me, but you weren't you.
You were sticking to me like a scab...
so I peeled you away, and bled for days.
Then stepped out of myself.

I'm shedding skin, changing within, I'm falling in.
Through swollen eyes, I dreamed you died, caught inside.
I'm shedding skin, spreading thin, severed stem.
I created the end, I'm killing a friend. I'm shedding my skin.

I don't think you belong in here,
I feel I'm sick.
Don't ask because you know damn well where I've been.
I've kept a simple woman through the thick and thin.
But I've found the guts to sever from my Siamese twin.

I throw you away. Everyday. A dead part of life.
Strangling back. Seething black.
In between my longing for torture.
Blood on my face that came from your face.
The mix of kissing and bleeding.
I put you away. I shut you away.
I pissed you away. I threw you away.

I'm shedding skin, changing within, I'm falling in.
Through swollen eyes, I dreamed you died, caught inside.
I'm shedding skin, spreading thin, severed stem.
I created the end, I'm killing a friend. I'm shedding my skin.

You're fucking, and sucking.
You're friendless. It's endless.
Your flower has soured.
It's endless. You're friendless.
It's harder. And stronger.
But no one's been inside you longer.
Or harder. Or deeper.
To get you off, you need the fear.

It's never love. Bloody touch.
Broken wrist. Needle rust.
Choking throat. Swallowed teeth.
Head fuck. No peace.
I'm shedding my skin to peel you off of me.
You've got to love me.

Ornament. Shrunken head.
Playtoy. Snake strike.
Poisonous. Syphilis.
Drenched me. Soaked me.
I'm shedding my skin to drain you out of me.
You've got to hate me.


10. Use My Third Arm

Enlight your sense of thought, of touch,
of real, a shield, an underground for this coward.
Building a blood in water scent.
It's like some raping,
without judgement.
Boy in a pocket.
Balls in a bag.
Serve and protect you.
His dick his gun, his brain his badge.

A faster way to kill them all would take too goddamn long.
Absorb through pores the great escape.

Kill that fuck to show him up.
Equal his displeasure now.
Stab his ass, a reminded past of what the fuck we live for.

Ourselves.

Arm yourself. A branch. A third arm.
Extend your health, crawl inside euphoria.
Building a blood in water scent.
It's like a scraping. It's entrapment.
Boy in a pocket.
Balls in a bag.
Perverted handle.
His getting by is a fisted fuck.

A faster way to exterminate them takes too fucking
long. Absorb through pores the great escape.

Kill that fuck to show him up.
Equal his displeasure now.
Stab his ass, a reminded past of what the fuck we live for.

Ourselves.

Half-assed for most his life.
Piss poor little ham.
Narc boy a fake fuck limp dick.
Sucking up to the man.
And the world.
We need a fucking cold war.

Building a blood in water scent
It's like a raping
Without judgement
Boy in a pocket
Balls in a bag
Perverted handle
His dick his gun, his brain his badge

Kill that fuck to show him up
Equal your displeasure now
Stab his ass a reminded past of what the fuck we're living for

Our fucking selves!


11. Throes Of Rejection

This is feeding what I am.

It's like salt poured into a deep, infected wound.
It's the type of pain you really dig and long for.
I've always been insecure to open up and show love.
Some pretty girl with long hair, some bald guy writhing.

Rejection...

The kind that's self induced.
The tongue that's bitten through.
The nauseating stab.
Is feeding what I am.

A short fuse.

If there really is a god, then it's punishing me constantly.
She let me taste that sugarhole and of course, I wanted more.
But no. I'm reduced to a Rohypnol snort and a lot of drinks.
This shit goes on and on. Just look down my pants.

Rejection...
It ain't a fucking game.
My human dick to blame.
A sociopathic plan.
Is feeding what I am.

Rejection...
Takes life away from eyes.
Will give you to the skies.
It makes me more than a man.
Is drowning what I am.


12. Planet Caravan

[Black Sabbath song taken from the Paranoid album]

We sail through endless skies
Stars shine like eyes
The black night sighs

The moon in silver trees
Falls down in tears
Light of the night

The earth, a purple blaze
Of sapphire haze
In orbit always

While down below the trees
Bathed in cool breeze
Silver starlight breaks down the night

And so we pass on by the crimson eye
Of great god Mars
As we travel the universe


13. The Badge

[Bonus track]
[Poison Idea cover]

Young and dumb, truth and justice, fantasy
Fresh out of the academy
Five-time loser bust his head, make your day
Unless you're paid off then you look away
Do you think this corruption will ever stop
What makes a person want to be a cop
Ran a red light, storm the house and bust the guy
Do you like to see his children cry

Pick up a hooker and take her for a little ride
But get sucked off on the side
Sworn to serve and protect, forget the killing
Badge-wearing fascist villain
Pissed in the street, you bust the guy
Do you like to see his children cry

The badge means you suck
A child lies there dead
As you look back, what goes through your head

Young and tough, truth and justice, fantasy
Fresh out of the academy
Five-time loser bust his head, make your day
Unless you're paid off then you look away
He burned a flag, storm the house and bust the guy
Do you like to see his children cry
Ran a red light, take her for a little ride
But get sucked off on the side

The badge means you suck
A child lies there dead
As you look back, what goes through your head

Talk to them, you can work it out
You better not even try it
You make a play for his gun
They'll kill you say it was a riot
RIOT

What's behind the badge?

1. The Great Southern Trendkill

It's wearing on my mind,
I'm speaking all my doubts aloud
You rob a dead mans grave,
Then flaunt it like you did create

If I hit bottom and everythings gone
In the great Mississippi, please drown me and run

It's digging time again,
you're nurturing the weakest trend

Those with the heart and the brain to get past this
Can spot a pathetic without even asking

Fuck your magazine,
and fuck the long dead plastic scene
Pierce a new hole,
if Hell was "in" you'd give your soul

THE GREAT SOUTHERN TRENDKILL
That's right,
THE GREAT SOUTHERN TRENDKILL

Buy it at a store,
from MTV to on the floor
You look just like a star,
it's proof you don't know who you are

If I hit bottom and everythings gone
In the great Mississippi, please drown me and run

It's bullshit time again,
you'll save the world within your trend

Those with the heart and the brain to get past this
Can spot a pathetic without even asking

Politically relieved,
you're product sold and well received
The right words spoken gold,
if I was God you'd sell your soul to...

THE GREAT SOUTHERN TRENDKILL
That's right,
THE GREAT SOUTHERN TRENDKILL


2. War Nerve

Truly, fuck the world,
for all it's worth,
every inch of planet Earth,
fuck myself,
don't leave me out,
but don't get involved,
don't corner me

Inside, ulcer,
unjust bastards,
file out face first
Meet the lies and see what you are

[Pre]

It's forcing you down, and it's grinding against you
Let the war nerve break

[Chorus]

For every fucking second the pathetic media pisses on me and
judges what I am in one paragraph - Look here - Fuck you all

Expect the worse,
you bleeding heart,
but kill me first
before it starts,
yes my cock is getting hard,
we are born different after all

Invite mayhem,
produce weapons,
shoot out,
burn down
No CNN or media now

[Pre]
[Chorus]

All the money in the fucking world couldn't buy me one second of trust
or one ounce of faith in anything you're about
Fuck you all

Nothing is worth the sleep that I've lost
Apologies unacceptable now
A blistered revenge awaits in me
This is fucking loveless

Hate
Hate mail is not read, in jail instead
Hate

The Lord knows,
there's worse
Ignore, this curse
Hate


3. Drag The Waters

A smack on the wrists is the words from the mouth
of the outsiders, lawyers, police
A small price to pay for the dope and the guns
and the rape, it should all be O.K.
Your father is rich, he's the judge, he's the man,
he's the God that got your sentence reduced
But in the back of his mind, he well knows what
he'd find if he looked a little deeper in you - in you

Drag the waters some more
Like never before

Sweet is the slice and the lips - you're gonna have that woman -
she is your favorite lay
Promised you (swore) that no one had been there,
and she was going to keep it that way
Let it move in, you got thin, and got high, and
your money went and so did your friends
But she's by your side, and her smile cannot hide
the premonition of the beckoning end - the end

Drag the waters some more
Like never before

In with it, out with it


4. 10's

My skin is cold,
Transfusion with somebody
Morose and old,
Drop into fruitless dying

It was tempting and bared,
The whoring angel rising
Now burning prayers,
My silent time of losing

My foes - they can't destroy my body
Colliding slow, like life itself

Long for the blur,
We cannot dry much longer
Cement to dirt,
Disgusted with my cheapness

My foes - they can't destroy my body
Colliding slow, like life itself

Reaching down, staring up (at the forgiver)


5. 13 Steps To Nowhere

Whores
Your windows boarded up,
Your private lives exposed
The talk shows pump it up,
Lab rats diseased for show

We're doomed to use the slang,
Outbreak of drug roulette
A church burned to the ground,
Not even noticed yet

13 Steps (To Nowhere)

Whores

A backwards swastika,
The black skin riddled in lead
A Nazi Gangster Jew,
It beats a dog that's dead

It's in to use the slang,
Outbreak of gun roulette
The cross slants to the side,
Will prove the damnedest yet

13 Steps - Leads to nowhere

The backlash dislocates,
An untimely reign of death
The wolf poked with the stick,
Awaits with cancerous breath

(Leads to nowhere)

Outsiders still suppose,
There's Holy streets to roam
The truth should not surprise,
Your homes were built on lies

13 Steps


6. Suicide Note Pt. I

Cheap cocaine, a dry inhale, the pills that kill and take the pain away
Diet of life, shelter without, the face that cannot see inside yours and mine

[Pre]
When I'm hiding, when I need it,
it lets me breathe,
for our handle on this life, I don't believe
this time

[Chorus]
Would you look at me now?
Can you tell I'm a man?
With these scars on my wrists
To prove I'll try again
Try to die again, try to live through this night
Try to die again.....

Forever fooling, free and using,sliding down the slide that breaks a will
Mothers angel, getting smarter, how smart are you to regress unfulfilled?
It's a damn shame, but who's to blame?

[Pre]
[Chorus]


7. Suicide Note Pt. II

Out of my mind,
gun up to the mouth
No pretension, execution, live and learn , rape and turn
Fret not family,
nor pre-judged army
This is for me,
and me only, cowards only
Try it

[Chorus]
Don't you try to die, like me
It's livid and it's lies and makes graves
Graves descending down

It's not worth the time to try, to replenish a rotting life
I'll end the problem, facing nothing, fuck you off, fuck you all
Tortured history, addict of misery, this exposes me
for weakness is a magnet - watch me do it

[Chorus]

Why would you help anyone who doesn't want it,
doesn't need it, doesn't want your shit advice
when a mind's made up to go ahead and die?
What's done is done and gone, so why cry?

[Chorus]


8. Living Through Me (Hells' Wrath)

I cannot take the take,
your condition was nod awake
A selfish cryer, boldface liar,
robbing all of what you could take in

Stabbed towards a death,
a dirty smelling girl
Shit decisions, no provisions,
filling veins with juice of chaos

[Chorus]
Painted face, olive drab, swollen hole, empty bag,
sunken eyes, whining dog,
it's times like this you should pray for never

I broke your fucking mold
then threw away the cast,
new religion and new provisions,
it's amazing you're alive

Drop the needle and stop what you're changing into
Erase the end dissolving, disgrace is needed more

So I mended severed ties,
through flesh we cauterized
the undeserving, sliming, writhing,
I filled you up with watered promise

[Chorus]

[Chorus #2]
Spitting teeth, oral lust, alley fuck,
angel dust, anal whore, bleeding knees,
it's times like this to pray for murder
So now I've seen it all,
Hells' wrath,
no man has greater glory,
cause now you're living through me

So I'm done with saving you,
a gift unto myself,
a tired savior, a wasted favor,
and I'm lucky I'm alive

I broke your fucking mold
then threw away the cast

[Chorus]
[Chorus #2]


9. Floods

A dead issue,
don't wrestle with it,
deaf ears are sleeping
A guilty bliss,
so inviting (let me in),

nailed to the cross
I feel you, relate to you, accuse you
Wash away us all,
take us with the floods
Then throughout the night, they were raped and executed
Cold hearted world

Your language unheard of,
the vast sound of tuning out
The rash of negativity
is seen one sid edly,

burn away the day
The nervous, the drifting, the heaving
Wash away us all, take us with the floods
Then throughout the day mankind played with grenades
Cold hearted world
And at night they might bait the pentagram
Extinguishing the sun
Wash away man, take him with the floods


10. The Underground In America

Put in position to wage teenage mayhem
A common affair for the ones who are juiced
If it is weakness that grants us the power
We thrive on what's stronger than most of the world

Glass breaks
the dimming lights
sweat, heat and profane debate
the smart ones stay on the outside
while drunken heads and arms erupt

centered man swings a punch,
spits a tooth, postures odd
a punk rock escapade
five bucks a head to be king dick in the crowd

We are the ones who must sport the position

cheap beer
trendy clicks
lesbian love is accepted and right
shaved heads meet hair in the mix
blending the 80's and 90's with hate

Put in position to wage teenage mayhem
A common affair for the ones who are juiced
If it is weakness that grants us the power
We thrive on what's stronger than most of the world

Shows on
dates canceled
kicked out for reasons that seem so unfair
skin crusts against the cops
a foregone conclusion that's tired and beat

Ringworm,crabs and lice
V.D. ecstasy, speed and horse
a heaven of unmatched importance
an honor of sex to be stuck by the punk

Rich homes with money and food
abandoned for the bums on the street
a lifestyle that's unexplainable
don't try and save what is all meant to be

Put in position to wage teenage mayhem
A common affair for the ones who are juiced
If it is weakness that grants us the power
We thrive on what's stronger than most of the world

If it is free
from (a) family that's seen
you can just keep it
if you must beg
it's better instead
you must follow the etiquette

You know when it rains you're in your bed at home
You act so real when you are alone
You better not let the mohawked crowd see
Give it five years, you'll retire your piercings
You must admit that you mimic the weaklings


11. (Reprise) Sandblasted Skin

Scrape it, grind it, peel it, hide it
The trend is over and gone forever
Shelf it, box it, save it, frame it
You won't need that anymore,
it's on sale at the fucken dollar store

Waste of time,
pantomime,
circus doll,
at the local mall
Exterminate, it's all fake!
Exterminate, it's all fake

Sandblast yourself
Sandblast yourself
Sandblast
Sandblast
It's getting old, old, old

1. Hellbound

Eliminate, the life decline...
I've paid the masters with blood and hunger
...And it's not for sale by any stretch.
It's like religion without a Bible
And the Dragon lives inside my mouth
And it speaks in tongues, the word...

Hellbound - in Ft. Worth, Texas
Hellbound - Ft. Worth

Snakes, in Southern flames
To bring the thunder; the great decider
Would you believe in this or the ash?
I do believe it and it's taking over...
Accept

Born to a world so young and proud
But over your head hangs a black cloud
Grow your hair and crawl inside yourself
Because there you cannot hide
Facing fears that you'll overcome and one
Of these years you know you've won


2. Goddamn Electric

There is a part of me that's always sixteen
I've found the secret of eternal youth
Some get high on life or money, but there's an
Escape, drop out of the race.
- To walk through the world by ones self, you can't be
Protected... your trust is in whiskey and weed and
Black Sabbath - It's Goddamn Electric

Don't waste your time, embrace it
And then you'll know yourself
The change in you is Goddamn Electric

The weight of the world has lifted and parted
My eyes roll blind to sights that distracted
Through tunnel-vision and dope-hair blinders
I'll cut a path and evoke my will
- To walk through the world by ones self, you can't
Be protected... your trust is in whiskey and weed
And Slayer, it's Goddamn Electric

Don't fake your life - inhale it
And then you'll know yourself
The change in you is Goddamn Electric
Don't waste your time, embrace it
Annd then you'll know yourself
The change that is Goddamn Electric will focus>
The Mind's Eye...

One hand on the bottle, the other a shaking
Fist, rejuvinated, isolated, no pressure
From the outside, my sight's Goddamn Electric
And these eyes have seen a world
Goddamn Electric system...


3. Yesterday Don't Mean Shit

There's nothing special about it
It's either there when you're born or not
Gifted with talent are no big deal
Welcome to the death of a century...

Cause yesterday don't mean shit
What's over is over and nothing between
Yesterday don't mean shit
Because tomorrow's the day you have to face
There's no rewinding time
Yesterday don't mean shit
Yesterday don't mean shit

Reliving old reviews is a useless tool of confusion
Don't hold your breath for the turn-around
Come into the world of endless odds...

They'll tell you about guilt
And in time you'll face the darkness...
But darkness is a friend to you
Embrace and fly through the madness
Flying past God and wars and conflict
Oppressor in you [x2]
Plowing through minds and paranoia
Oppressor in you
The oppressor's in you

Yesterday don't mean jack shit...

To protect you and I'll keep to myself
It can only be that way - yeah!


4. You've Got To Belong To It

Build an inner door, drop and then explore
You smoke your head on straight, then drink
Your woes away -
Some might not understand possession
Controls your head

You recognize it, while some ignore it
Avoid the masses, you've got to belong to it

Your music is your friend? But the roof
Above my head. So seriously I take the will
That never breaks
Some might not understand, possession
Beyond your hands...

It's power and sin, and then you've got all the other habits
Whiskey and smoke
It's all that we could need, to plant the perfect
Seed, disembody me - yeah...


5. Revolution Is My Name

68' into the world born
And the Seventies, a breath after the war
Life was confusing because of my age
Should my eyes open for tomorrow’s gains?
I can't help the way I am
There's no trust and there's no end
What is my name?

It will never change
So here it stays
Forever is my name

From now on, can't look the other way
Keep in mind and listen to what I say
Take under wing all the ones who are lost
Build up around them an infinite wall
Don't you know just who I am?
Take the hand of wisdom's friend
What is my name?

It's time to change
It can't stay the same
Revolution is my name
It will never change
So here it stays
Forever is my name

What is my name?
Forever...

What is my name?
Revolution...


6. Death Rattle

Numbing rumble, countless medicine,
Depleted from years of abuse
Death rattle shaking
And there's no faking, undertaking

Pressure point, rigor mortis
Induce, grasp of poison hands
Death rattle shaking
From years of compulsive mistaking

Death rattle shakes

Disease of eyes, the addict blindfold, reduced to
The realms of death
Death rattle shaking
Accumulating life it’s taking

Death rattle shakes

I’ve seen the end, and there is no light.
Like deadly snakes, death rattle shakes


7. We'll Grind That Axe For A Long Time

Wears 10 crowns, dragons heads
Southern are the sons, Lords unmatched
- Their eyes don’t look right, should they be trusted now?
Trashed-mouth Gods, avoided kings
With the spirit of revolt, the ghost of youth

Every fucking year it stays the same
Everybody changes to suit the day
Out of pride I'll isolate my fears
Never turned our backs on why we're here
We'll grind that axe for a long time

Follow close, train of fools
Just like them, just like you
- Their eyes don't seem right.
"Easily impressed" plague, dressed up fake
No respect

Every fucking year remains the same
Everybody sucks-up to suit the day
Out of hate I'll isolate myself
Through the worst we still marched into hell
We'll grind that axe for a long time
The smell in the air is chicken shit.

We'll grind that axe for a long time

Every fucking song remains the same
To everyone who sucks-up for the fame
Out of strength you know we speak the truth
Every trend that dies is living proof
We'll grind that axe for a long time


8. Uplift

On one whole bottle "uplifting!"
There is no telling what I'll do
Run head first into traffic
A mindset of annihilation

No sense makes sense
You can't get bought without thought
Ahh... no sense makes sense
You can't get bought without thought inside
Your head now

Uplift - uplifting
Uplifting now

On hallucinogenic "uplift"
I can step out of my body
Religion is in myself
I'll split my head in two and see you twice

No sense makes sense
You can't get bought without thought
Ahh... no sense makes sense
You can't get bought without thought inside
your head now

Uplift... uplifting
Uplifting now...
Uplifting you now...

Give me alcohol extremeties
Instead of proofless christianity
Drunked up in a coma place
Critics disgusted, but a smile on my fucking face
I do anything that I want
And I get everything that I ask
And if this message bothers you, you know
Just kiss my fucking ass hole


9. It Makes Them Disappear

The time had finally come to kill the vein.
And I'm dropping down the dirt on your grave
It might hurt so bad, but I can't feel sad
Rid of a fool like you
The wrath has just begun
The time has finally come
And it hurts so bad, and it drives me mad
Life with a blinded view (of you)

It makes them disappear
It fills their life with fear
When their future isn't clear
It makes them disappear

- Gone -

So the coward has up and run to be saved
But with each step taken down, you sink in your grave
It might hurt so bad, but I can't feel sad
Rid of a fool like you

Get the fuck on down the road


10. I'll Cast A Shadow

The end will crush the light
And sends a message, It won't please
The naked eye
Without and end there is no light
To foretell, to blind you
The law of the claw reigns on and after still

When I die, I cast a shadow
And I'll rise, I cast a shadow

I'm leaving more eyes open
I close up both of mine
For the ones that chase my life
They're looking over shoulders
Let paranoia in
Spontaneously rule them

When I die, I cast a shadow
And I'll fly, I cast a shadow

Everybody get fucking up!
I cast a shadow...
I... I cast a shadow
I cast a shadow...
I... I cast a shadow

When I die, I cast a shadow
And I'll rise, I cast a shadow

1. Ride My Rocket

4. Latest Lover

She's the talk of the town
gets around

Love her, leave her
For all the wrong reasons
Love her, leave her
You might even

Who's been your latest lover?
Who's been in your bed?
Who's been your latest lover?
Who's been in your head?

Out on the streets
She ain't got enough to eat
Making a living off your time

Love her, leave her
For all the wrong reasons
Love her, leave her
You might even

Who's been your latest lover?

6. Metal Magic

when they say don't look back
do what they say
you gotta look ahead
to a better day
in a world of metal magic
you need a break
go forth
take a chance
make no mistake

Metal magic

they say you can't go back
oh so true
when you're a rocker baby

In a world of metal magic
magic never ends
sometimes you lose
and sometimes you win

Metal magic

Lost in the metal magic
it never ends
sometimes you lose
sometimes you win

Metal magic
Metal magic

4. Like Fire

Don't get in her way, a sharp shooter that never miss
She's comin' on like a hurricane, might burn your finger tips
Her eyes could blow your mind with a look right on the spot
And once she starts, she'll tear you apart, boy she makes it hot
She's

LIKE FIRE, tearing up the night, like dynamite
LIKE FIRE, spreading through the town, you'll never slow her down

She's got everything it takes, to keep you satisfied
She'll get you down, let her hands do the talking, ain't no place to hide

Get on her knees, just a' screamin' to please,
Take a chance on gettin' burned
She's
LIKE FIRE, she's burning hot, everything she's got
LIKE FIRE, tearing up the night, just like dynamite
LIKE FIRE, spreading through my town, you'll never slow her down
LIKE FIRE


5. In Over My Head

All alone
This lonely night
I've been thinkin' about you
And I'm on my own
Just ain't right
Well I don't know where I'm gonna go

I can't take it
I can't make it alone
No

I'm in over my head
Thought it would be easy or not
But it's harder instead
I'm in over my head
Over my head
Without you

I can't sleep
I need your touch
Lying here right beside me
I was in too deep
Meant too much
Something free that reminds me

I can't take it
I can't make it alone
No

I'm in over my head
Thought it would be easy or not
But it's harder instead
I'm in over my head
Over my head
Without you

I keep thinkin' love is gonna find a way
I feel it comin' love will find a way

I'm in over my head
Thought it would be easy or not
But it's harder instead
I'm in over my head
Over my head
Without you

I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head

Over my head

Over

Over


6. Projects In The Jungle

I come from the jungle
I'm free from the trade
No one can stop me
I'm panic, I'm brave

I am the one there
That had no shame
No one mock me
I played my game

Can you hear it?
Call of the wild
Hey man, it's screamin'
Driving me wild

Projects in the jungle
Projects in the jungle
Projects in the jungle
Projects in the jungle

Here to my eyes
I'm bad as hell
Run like the tiger
That's playin' the bell

I am hunger
Look in my stare
I'm not a human
I'm a beast in bed

Can you hear it?
Call of the wild
Hey man, it's screamin'
I'm going wild

Projects in the jungle
Projects in the jungle
Projects in the jungle
Projects

Projects in the jungle
Projects in the jungle
Projects in the jungle

7. Heavy Metal Rules

All my life, it's been the same
Too many rules if you wanna play the game
Don't do this, don't do that
Your mom and dad, they know where it's at
I'll show 'em all, a thing or two
I found a game I know how to do
Put on your leather, snap on your spikes
Me and the boys are hot rockin' tonight
I'll stick my fist, high in the air
I'll make a sign, 'cause I don't care
Heavy Metal Rules!

It's the same corruption, everywhere I look
There's a brand new rule inside a brand new book
Some people claim that the devil is loose
They blame it all on the rock 'n' roll youth
That don't stop me, I'm on a roll
I found the noise, bangin' my soul
So take it up, loud as you can
There's just one rule that I understand
I'll stick my fist, high in the air
I'll make a sign, 'cause I don't care
Heavy Metal Rules!


8. Only A Heartbeat Away

I remember the first time your lips met mine
We were young and innocent, we had plenty of time
The years have gone and passed us by, don't run and hide
Think of all the things we had, and what you're feeling inside
Feeling inside
Take me, take all of my love
Take me, I can give you so much
Only a heartbeat, only a heartbeat away
Only a heartbeat, only a heartbeat away

So close, but so far away,
You say you love me, but you can't stay
Hear me now, we're wasting time
Take a chance, loves on the line
Love's on the line
Take me, take all of my love
Take me, I can give you so much
Only a heartbeat, only a heartbeat away
Only a heartbeat, only a heartbeat away


9. Killers

I'm so tough, hear my motor revving up
Who yeah, keep on and take it away
Well hold tight it's Saturday night
Sorry but I just can't fade, no way
We're gonna shake it loose party all night
She got my number but that's alright
Killers, runnin' loose

We'll case the whole town
I know she's been around
She's got me running that's for sure
Yeah so knocked up, bad girls lick it up
They got the jump boys
And there ain't no cure
We're gonna make it loose shake it in the air
Their mamas coming but we don't care
Killers, running loose
Killers, running loose

I'm gonna cut it loose show 'em what we've got
Party all night long ain't never gonna stop
Thank you killers, runnin' loose
And we're killers, runnin' loose


10. Takin' My Life

I can see
I know it was meant to be
You can be what you want to be
Just set yourself free

Oh my life
Been trying so hard to get it right
Been searching in the night
Trying to set myself free

Now I can't turn my back and walk out the door
Now that I know found out what I'm living for

I'm taking my life into my own hands
Got to be strong got to be a man
Takin' my life

No No No
No more no more living in a mystery
I'm not going to let it get the best of me
Takin' my life

I know it was meant to be
You can be what you want to be
Just set yourself free

Now I can't turn my back and walk out the door
Now that I know found out what I'm living for

I'm taking my life into my own hands
Got to be strong got to be a man
Takin' my life
No No No
No more no more living in a mystery
I'm not going to let it get the best of me
Takin' my life

1. Rock The World

In these times
Of confusion and sin
We must redeem
Our human ways
This force that
Fights to live
Will fight
Till it dies
And rise again
To save the day

[CHORUS]
WE ALL
ROCK THE WORLD
WE ALL
ROCK THE WORLD

The power grows
To destroy
This flag of hate
That waves so
High in the air
We raise our fists
In rebellion we stand
Our hungry hearts
Set the snare

[CHORUS]

Ageless as time
Change is revealed
We will rock for you


2. Power Metal

You say you want it loud
I'll never turn it down
You wanta feel my power
Pound you in the ground

Blow your head apart

From the very start

You say you want some Metal

My deadly grasp is lethal
This force will never stop

POWER METAL

POWER METAL

The battle dog I deal
My soul was spawned in hell
My body coiled steel
Put on this earth to
Melt it down to the core
I'll make you feel such pain
You're comin' back for more

You say you want some Metal
I'll give you all i've got
My deadly grasp is lethal
This force will never stop

POWER METAL
ROCK FOREVER
POWER METAL
ON FOREVER


3. We'll Meet Again

I walk the
Streets of darkness
Where hell awaits
Guarded by the mystery
Just beyond the gates
Searching for the answer
Every man must find
Before eternity beckons
I will make you mine

GOODBYE MYSTERY
GOODBYE PAIN
GOODBYE LOVE
WE'LL MEET AGAIN

In another lifetime
She'll take another man
She's left me here to die!
Its killing me again!!!!!!!!!!

GOODBYE MYSTERY
GOODBYE PAIN
GOODBYE LOVE
WE'LL MEET AGAIN


4. Over And Out

Slaving for eternity
Aiming for construction
Wreckless crew abandon me
Bringing on destruction
Primal needs, annoying ways
INCAPACITATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A legacy of submankind
Who seem to rule this nation

Out of touch with your life
Can' t you see the signs
For me to know
Can you find out
Read betwen the lines

NO WAY OUT
When the cat goes away
OVER AND OUT
The mice come out and play

Unrelentless trilogy
Asking to accept them
Tempers flare
Screams are heard
To uphold the profession
Time and time and times again
I will not play your game
I ask you once a billion times
To keep your life the same

NO WAY OUT
When the cat goes away
OVER AND OUT
The mice come out and play
NO WAY OUT
The price that you must pay
OVER AND OUT
Ev'ry dog has its day


5. Proud To Be Loud

Listen up good
I got a lot to say
I know what I want
And I get my own way
I call 'em as I see 'em
I don't play by the book
One dose of volume
That's all it took
I've seen it, I've done it
I've heard it before
Now it's my turn
To settle the score
I'll sing it, I'll shout it
I'll say it again
I don't care if they
Never give in cause I'm

PROUD TO BE LOUD
PROUD TO BE LOUD
YOU KNOW I'M PROUD
PROUD TO BE LOUD

Well I've alway believed
In freedom of speech
And i've always been the one
Who practiced what I preached
LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT
I'll give you the choice
But it'll snow in hell
Before I lower my voice
I live it, I breathe it
I gotta have more
It's full blast
And this means war
The power, the glory
Its callin' my name
I won't start to
Play their game cause I'm

PROUD TO BE LOUD
PROUD TO BE LOUD
I'M PROUD TO BE LOUD
AND I'LL NEVER
TURN IT DOWN AGAIN NO!!
PROUD TO BE LOUD
PROUD TO BE LOUD
I'M PROUD,
PROUD TO BE LOUD

For another victim to come

Thrill of it all
Its such a chill
To watch the meek just fall

DEATH TRAP DEATH TRAP

8. Hard Ride

You're in the danger zone
You can't be left alone
Your heart is

But when it comes down to it
You spoke your mind and you blew it
I want you when I want
And still I hear you say

[CHORUS]

HARD RIDE WITH ME

But you seem so far away !!!!!!

1. Instinctive (Slaughterlust)

Here kindness ends
Weakness dies, trust myself
No one else
Never bow, never break
So I tap into the savagery

I have become
Instinctive
I have become
Instinctive
Like an animal
Untamable
I have become instinctive
Like a savage
Barbaric
I have become instinctive

Come with me down the abyss
Where shadows spawn from emptiness
I must transform to shed this husk
New urge to fulfill my slaughterlust
I sacrifice to dominate
My savage nature now unleashed
Breath swift and sharp against clenched teeth
Animal intuition empowers me

Transform, shed this husk
Must fulfill my slaughterlust
Transform, shed this husk
Must fulfill my slaughterlust

Here kindness ends
Weakness dies, trust myself
No one else
Never bow, never break
So I tap into the savagery

I have become
Instinctive
I have become
Instinctive
Like an animal
Untamable
I have become instinctive
Like a savage
Barbaric
I have become instinctive

Tap into the savagery
Tap into the savagery

I am unhinged, I terrify
I'd rather die than toe the line
Do what I must, fight to survive
Primitive bloodlust fills my mind
My vision's clear, my instinct strong
I am the vicious one
Inclination to destroy
Like a savage with carnage in his eyes

Transform, shed this husk
Must fulfill my slaughterlust
Transform, shed this husk
Must fulfill my slaughterlust

Unleash the savage instinct
Savage
Instinct
Unleashed


2. Let Them All Rot

Give them what they want
New ways to die
Pile all the heads
Pile them high
Give them what they want
New ways to die
Pile all the heads
Pile them high
Give them what they want
New ways to die
Pile all the heads
Pile them high
Give them what they want
New ways to die
Pile all their heads and...

Let them rot!
Let them all fucking rot!
Let 'em rot

Welcome to the land of the psychic dead
Breeding ground for the living condemned
No meaning, no shame, just blind consumption
Minds of the weak in perpetual dysfunction

Give them what they want

Give them what they want
New ways to die
Pile all the heads
Pile them high
Give them what they want
New ways to die
Pile all the heads
Pile them high
Give them what they want
New ways to die
Pile all their heads and...

Let them rot!
Let them all fucking rot!
Let 'em rot

Enter the mind of the spiritually doomed
Gratification never comes too soon
Demoralization, worship the sick
Absorb the trauma, then re-inflict
Re-inflict
Absorb the trauma
Then re-inflict
Give them what they want!

Pile all the heads
Pile them high
Pile all their heads and...

Let them rot!
Let them all fucking rot!
Let 'em rot

Give them what they want
New ways to die
Pile all the heads
Pile them high
Give them what they want
New ways to die
Pile all their heads and...
Let them rot


3. Set It Right (Start With Yourself)

If you think you should judge someone
Start with yourself
If you want to take control
Start with yourself
Something you see needs respect
Start with yourself
And if you want to change the world, you have to
(Start with yourself)

Deal with this now or it never goes away
It might not bring Heaven on Earth but it keeps Hell at bay
(Start with yourself)
There's purpose in the pain, new power to attain
You've turned away before, old ways never open new doors

Set it right, set it right
Make peace with the mirror now
Set it right, set it right
End the self-deception
Set it right, set it right
Make peace with the mirror now
Set it right, set it right
End the self-deception

If you think you should judge someone
Start with yourself
If you want to take control
Start with yourself
Something you see needs respect
Start with yourself
And if you want to change the world, you have to
(Start with yourself)

Use this for your gain, single-minded aim
You draw your own blood when pointing out another's shame
(Start with yourself)
Deal with this now before it comes back around
How many chances do you think you'll get if you keep shutting down?

Set it right, set it right
Make peace with the mirror now
Set it right, set it right
End the self-deception
Set it right, set it right
Make peace with the mirror now
Set it right, set it right
No more self-deception

That which you do not wish to look at
Has to be seen
You've sunken lower than your nightmares
Now be risen higher than your dreams

It can be set right, you have to
(Start with yourself)
If you think you should judge someone
(Start with yourself)
If you want to take control
(Start with yourself)
Something you see needs respect
(Start with yourself)
And if you're going to change the world, you have to
Start with yourself


4. Weight Of The False Self

If you want to make a difference in the world it means
You have to be different from the world you see
Free yourself from burdens that you know exist
Don't carry the curse of the fatalist

Your true self calls and you must answer

Life the weight of the false self crushing you
Lift yourself up from malevolence
Lift the curse of the fatalist haunting you
Lift yourself out from the death grip
Lift the burden upon your shoulders

There's a challenge that's begging to be risen to
There's a voice and it's your true self calling you
End the cycle, kill all willful self-abuse
Never justify another excuse

5. Cling To Life

I'm helpless here, holding lifeless hands
Didn't see this coming
This was never planned
Once we had everything, now we see
How quickly life can change, how cruel it can be

(Truth is) I don't know what lies ahead
(Truth is) No one's ever faultless
(Truth is) Not always in sight
Truth is hard to stomach when you feed yourself lies

Cling to life
Our belief is what unites
Cling to life
Never let your lows steal your heights
Cling to life
Reach for the light
Our belief is what unites
Cling to life
I ask that you reach out, follow the light and don't let go

It's tragic, here you lay expressionless
What once was vibrant became emptiness
If I could just command your body not to wither
If I could just turn back the years and not be bitter

(Truth is) We have to brave the depths
(Truth is) It can all collapse
(Truth is) Not what pulls us apart
Truth is the beating of your fearless heart

There's truth in resisting
What pulls us apart
When I know I still feel the beating of your fearless heart

There's truth you can't divide
In this we can unite
Truth is hard to stomach when you feed yourself lies

(Truth is) I should've done what was needed
(Truth is) Others failed when you succeeded
(Truth is) What is broken can mend
Truth is all of this comes to an end

Cling to life
Our belief is what unites
Cling to life
Never let your lows steal your heights
Cling to life, reach for the light
Our belief is what unites
Cling to life
I ask that you reach out, follow the light and don't let go


6. A Stroke Of Red

There's no harm done until the harm is done to me

It calls me close as it comes to me
Telling me to forget this world
Erase my life, release this ghost
Longing for a violent rebirth
A stroke of red on this canvas of flesh
Faint caress, prolong the sting
Just another prisoner longing to be free
A stroke of red is all I need

Now there's no harm done (Harm done)
Harm isn't done
Until the harm is done to me
There's no harm done (Harm done)
Harm isn't done
Until the harm is done to me
Done to me

Body drifting over what I've become
I see them but they'll never see me
(See me)
So much bleeding just to feel so numb
Desires fulfilled in blasphemy
A stroke of red on this canvas of flesh
Faint caress, prolong the sting
One last brush to finish my masterpiece
A stroke of red is all I need

Now there's no harm done (Harm done)
Harm isn't done
Until the harm is done to me
There's no harm done, harm done
Harm isn't done
Until the harm is done to me
Now there's no wrong done (Wrong done)
No wrong is done
Unless the wrong is done to me
There's no wrong done (Wrong done)
If I'm in the wrong, then there was wrong done to me

Whispers from the skin entice
Addicted to the numbness of the sickening slice
Incisions you see are nothing to hide
Nothing compared to the ones inside

It's all I need
Another stroke of red to be free
A stroke of red

Ahh, there's no harm done (Harm done)
Harm isn't done
Until there's harm is done to me
There's no wrong done (Wrong done)
No wrong is done
Until the wrong is done to me
Done to me


7. Dig Your Way Out

Try as you might when all theories fail
No hesitation into the pale
Urge overtakes and the moment dies
In a crashing wave your wrists are tied

It's all caving in on you
It's all caving in on you
(Dig your way out)
It's all caving in on you
It's all caving in on you
(Dig your way out)

Don't promise, just prove
Don't fear, push through
Don't chase the pain
Become it

The urge overtakes it was nothing but an urge
The reason to go on must be unearthed
You can't just spend your whole life waiting
Pushing to the surface as it's caving

It's all caving in on you
It's all caving in on you
(Dig your way out)
It's all caving in on you
It's all caving in on you
(Dig your way out)

Don't promise, just prove
Don't fear, push through
Don't chase the pain
Become it
Don't promise, just prove (Just prove)
Don't fear, push through (Push through)
Don't hesitate
Live through it

Don't promise, just prove (Just prove)
Don't fear, push through (Push through)
When the urge overtakes
Don't chase the pain, become it

Dig your way out

Engage the crippling doubt of loss and love
Stunned by visions of what once was
Grief and deceit with sorrow feeds the angst
Comfort is destruction, there can be no more relief


8. This I Earned

Fiction you made up to believe
Lives on a screen but it's not reality
Actions that you didn't take
Is why you're concerned with the ones that I make
Now you've noticed your day slipping fast
Was it well spent or were you stepping back?
You counted all my blessings as you went
Leaving your mark of discontent

(This I earned)
I wasn't born with it
I bled for this
Be bound to your word
When you live by it
You prove your worth

(This I earned)
It wasn't handed to me
I did what I had to
Be bound to your word
It's not what you deserve, you get what you earn

Don't indulge in delusions to satisfy
I don't escape today with dreams gone by
Perfection of the present doesn't exist
The future's at stake, it isn't granted

For this I bled
For this I bled
My blood I shed for this

You want a future worth fighting for?
With skin in the game?
Be bound to your word
Everything is at stake

My blood
My blood I shed for this
My blood
My blood I shed for this

You think this was handed to me?
Some offering taken at birth
I've withstood every hardship
To prove myself of worth

(This I earned)
I wasn't born with it
I bled for this
Be bound to your word
When you live by it
You prove your worth
(This I earned)
It wasn't handed to me
I did what I had to
Be bound to your word
It's not what you deserve, you get what you earn

Earned in blood
A life that's well deserved
Take what's due
Once you prove your worth
(Earn it)


9. Wings Of The Vulture

They only take to the skies once death arrives

Through a darkened sky, so clear to see
Unveiling the closeness of morbidity
As light hits the eye, no sympathy
The talons sharper than they've ever been

Lower, lower, lower sweeps the wings of the vulture
Lurking peril trembles in the mind
Lower, lower, lower sweeps the wings of the vulture
Awaiting the bones they will pick dry
After demise

They only take to the skies once death arrives

A distant recollection has been stirred
Compelled against this life at every turn
Now high above the growing swarm is seen
The scattered fragments whispering to be free

Lower, lower, lower sweeps the wings of the vulture
Lurking peril trembles in the mind
Lower, lower, lower sweeps the wings of the vulture
Fear ridden hunger haunted flight

After demise
Descending from the sky
Once death arrives
When the end is close by
Cleansing death inside

Where there once was life

They only begin descent
When decay is evident
Always there when death arrives
Crowning evolution by design


10. The Herd Will Scatter

Consistent
Conscious
Deliberate
Intent to deceive
Decided voices
Spreading the myths to believe
Repeating falsehoods
Destroying as it spreads
Discourage the thinker
Discredit the messengers

From those who have nothing
So much more will be taken
(More will be taken)
To those who have everything
So much more will be given
(More will be given)

(We knew) There would come a time when
(We knew) Lies would be brought into
The light
Now the fear runs rampant
They strike and the herd will scatter
Playing upon their fears
Playing upon their fears

The senses flooded the future
Unrelenting bleakness
Sowing misfortune
Reaping perpetual disaster
Surrender no longer an option
Dissipation
Degraded purpose
Abandoned isolation

From those who have nothing
So much more will be taken
(More will be taken)
To those who have everything
So much more will be given
(More will be given)

The light shown upon the shepherd
They strike and the herd will scatter
Once the fear runs rampant
They'll be unattended
Once they strike the shepherd down

Strike the shepherd and the herd will scatter
Isolation spells death


11. From Gold To Gray

Oh, I don't want your pity
Won't bargain for my soul
Not another form with reason fled
Can't be another object of dread
Each for himself must carve a path
While wretched life imposes wrath
Through tangled webs that leave us worn
Into crowded graves to be ignored

Life is cold enough
I won't be frozen in the memories
Life is cold enough
Cold enough for me to remain

From gold to gray, nothing stays
We live amidst the soundless storms of decay
(Life is cold enough)
From gold to gray, nothing stays
You leave a footprint whether you wait or walk away

Someone always wants to make it worse
The slumbering soul whose words are cursed
Time is fleeting, we're always reminded
Still we labor, willfully blinded
Reality is cold, my mind is colder
Biding my time until it's truly over
Frozen still, our hearts will yearn
Enter the fray to dust return

Life is cold enough
I won't be frozen in the memories
Life is cold enough
Cold enough for me to remain

From gold to gray, nothing stays
We live amidst the soundless storms of decay
(Life is cold enough)
From gold to gray, nothing stays
You leave a footprint whether you wait or walk away

Enter the fray

One foot in the gold, one foot in the gray
Some will learn it'll be too late
The fortunes of time unable to change
Left to our own dark imaginings

From gold to gray, nothing ever stays
From gold to gray, we enter the fray
Life is cold but my mindset is colder
Enter the fray once it's over


12. Invoking Dominance

Enough chances have drifted by
I must reclaim what's mine
Reclaim what's mine
Invoking dominance inside
If it means I put my life on the line
This choice cannot be denied
Now I reclaim what's mine

Test the waters, think you know pain
Enter unforgiving domain
Thought this was over
Challenge my will, I'm going for the kill
Thought you could poke the scorpion's nest
Feel the venom in your heart as it seizes in your chest
You thought this was over
It's not over till you take your final breath

As you gasp, I'll be taking back
Taking back what's mine
I'll put everything on the line
When my fists are pouring blood
I'll know I did everything I could
Putting it on the fucking line
Now I reclaim what's mine

You knew how this would end
Still you chose to step into the lion's den
Now it's never over
Thought I'd be your prey
Tried to take my dignity
Nothing left to lose, can't live on my knees
You'll be snared in the jaws of defeat
Fools die in horror, not knowing why, never how

Reclamation
Through the nothingness, I climb
Reclamation
Hostilities come alive
Reclamation
With powers outside my own
Reclamation
Engraved in Stone

Enough chances have drifted by
I must reclaim what's mine
Reclaim what's mine
Invoking dominance inside
Reclamation
Reclamation
Living fire galvanized
Reclamation
Reclamation
Dominance inside

1. Proven

You want to see me fail
You won't get your chance
You want to see me fail
You won't get your chance
You'll never get your chance

This is our lives
This is who we are
You can't put a price on it
It's strength within our hearts

From within our souls
Stood strong throughout the years
This runs through our veins
We stay true to ourselves

(You want to see me fail...)

Who are you to judge us
Who are you to condemn us
I have respect, honour and dedication
For my family and friends

From within our souls
Stood strong throughout the years
This runs through our veins
We stay true to ourselves

(You want to see me fail...)
This is thicker than blood
Its all we have

PROVEN


2. Perserverance

I know your fear of loss
And your struggles with faith
And how it takes everything that you have to face the day
The virtues you possess now bring you eternal pain
All you have is contempt for a life you can't obtain
All your heroes have failed you
Yet you try and prevail
Face your torment and dismantle your doubt
Refuse this legacy of shame and deceit
Cause the only real truth in your life that you know is hostility

Your world is coming apart
Remain steadfast

Perseverance
Against all opposition
Crushing all limitations
Pure strength through solitude
Discipline and determination

You can't accept what you've been told
Anchored in sin you must reverse your descent
Declare the weight of the world has yet to claim you
And admit that your faults will not restrain you
Glimpses of fate bring light to your despair
Realise hope isn't short of your grasp
Resurrect every dream that you've buried alive
And never succumb to the war that you fight in your heart

Your world is coming apart
Remain steadfast

Perseverance
Against all opposition
Crushing all limitations
Pure strength through solitude
Discipline and determination


3. You're Never Alone

This is for the kids who have no where to turn
Who have nothing to live for
You think you haven't the will to persist
You have to search within yourself

All the work that you've done in vain
Been overlooked and taken for granted
Only you can end your suffering
You must be honest with yourself
You have nothing left to lose
You feel that everyone's out to get you
Been beaten down but the hate still breathes
Confined by consequences, it's your soul you must release

It's our struggles that define us
And the hardships we endure
Your spirit can't be broken now
You've come too far

All your life
You told yourself you were never alone
All your time
Spent on the problems that have no solution
In your mind
Giving up was never an option
Out of spite
Hold onto the hate that has helped you stay focused

You are one but you're never alone
You can't atone for every promise you've broken
In this moment there's no way you will fail
You must be honest with yourself
Use your pain to achieve your goals
Make amends while you can and stay focused
You can't be burdened by your lack of control
Never stray from the path you have chosen

(It's our struggles...)

(All your life...)

(This is for the kids...)

This spirit can't be broken [x3]
It's who you are

(It's our struggles...)

Forever
Forever
Forever convicted [x2]


4. I Will Be Heard

Now is the time for me to rise to my feet
Wipe your spit from my face
Wipe these tears from my eyes

Now is the time for me to rise to my feet
Wipe your spit from my face
Wipe these tears from my eyes

I've got to take my life back
One chance to make it right
I've gotta have my voice be heard
And bring meaning to this life

Cause I've trusted for nothing
I've been led astray
I've been tried and tested
But I won't accept defeat
Now I've done things I regret
And its time to reverse the rules
I just want to make good on
All the promises that I have made

I will be
I will be...I will be heard
I will be...I will be heard

Now is the time for me to rise to my feet (I will be heard)
Wipe your spit from my face
Wipe these tears from my eyes (I will be heard)

Through the worst we prevail
So our voices will be heard
Through the worst we prevail
So our voices will be heard
Through the worst we prevail
So our voices will be heard
Through the worst we prevail
So our voices will be

Now is the time for me to rise to my feet
Wipe your spit from my face
Wipe these tears from my eyes

Now is the time for me to rise to my feet
Wipe your spit from my face
Wipe these tears from my eyes

I've got to take my life back
One chance to make it right
I've gotta have my voice be heard
And bring meaning to this life

Cause I've trusted for nothing
I've been led astray
I've been tried and tested
But I won't accept defeat
Now I've done things I regret
And its time to reverse the rules
I just want to make good on
All the promises that I have made

I will be
I will be...I will be heard
I will be...I will be heard

Now is the time for me to rise to my feet (I will be heard)
Wipe your spit from my face
Wipe these tears from my eyes (I will be heard)

I will be


5. A Call For Blood

Your reign of terror is coming to an end
And all your victims' pain will be avenged
Taker of innocence, I want your demise
Tear you apart for the unspeakable things you tried to hide

I fucking hate you
Every bone in my body will ache
`Till I destroy everything you love
And fill your life with their pain

Ten long fucking years
I waited to erase all the memories
And you can't fucking stop me
My vengeance is finally born
Ten long fucking years
Your reign of terror is coming to an end
And I have no mercy for your soul
Your blood is on my hands

A call for blood
For what you've done
No tolerance (for what you've done)
A call for blood
For what you've done
No tolerance (for what you've done)

All their anguish, all their pain
All their nightmare, all their misery
It's all coming back to haunt you
Your time is up and you've no where to hide

(I fucking hate you...)

(Ten long fucking years...)

(A call for blood...)
No fucking tolerance.

Let the blood spill
Vengeance is born [x2]

A call for blood.


6. Below The Bottom

Half dead, you trod through life
So dependent, a shell of a man
Pitiful, you let your vices tell your fate
Follower of the blind, you have nothing.
My empathy has turned to rage.
My pity has turned to hatred.
In selfishness you've sunken to the depths.
How much lower can you go?

All virtue decayed, now a memory
So many friendships lost.
Only enemies.
Shame I feel for you, pain I feel for you.
To cleanse yourself you've got to let go.
Are you not alone now?
Are you not what you've become?
I want to give you the strength to overcome.
The strength to reject those who brought you down.
Take a look, take a look at yourself.
What do you see? What have you become?
You've gone below the bottom.
Take a look, take a look at yourself.
What do you see? What have you become?
You've gone below the bottom.

You've taken their lies as your own.
Tried to justify your own hypocrisy.
You bear the mark of consequence.
You've lied to yourself, you've lied to me.
You've betrayed your own soul.
Sacrificed all you were.
In selfishness you've sunken to the depths.
How much lower can you go.

(All virtue decayed...)
I want to give you the strength to overcome.
The strength to reject those who have brought you down.

Take a look, take a look at yourself.
What do you see what have you become?
Take a look, take a look at yourself.
You've gone below the bottom.


7. We Still Fight

Talk of the causes you support
Voice your misdirected views
You only comment on the things you don't have the power to change
Do you even think before you speak
Do you know what it is you condone?
Take a look at the world today
You've taken your freedom and safety for granted

How do you justify (you have no right)
The way you disgrace those who gave their lives
And how do you justify (you have no right)
The way you disrespect those whose loved ones died.

Everyday is a different crusade
You revolt from the safety of your fantasies
Privileged, you've never fought for a thing
You'd be the first to go if there was real anarchy
All your jargon makes me sick
You're the farthest thing from an activist
You've lost sight of what's important and real
You've taken your freedom and safety for granted

(How do you justify...)

Kill!

This is dedicated to all those who gave their lives to uphold their beliefs
Not to those who try to demean their sacrifices
You have no right.

For those who fought our rights and for those who gave their lives.
And for the families whose love ones died.
It's their honor for which we still fight.


8. Unloved

When it all ended
There was no where to turn
I hid inside myself hoping someone would find me
That day never came
As the years passed the pain lessened
I thought your voice would silence forever
I was wrong

This time there's no turning back
Emerge from a doorway at the end of a war inside my soul
There's no picking up where we left off
And there will not be a future
I've died so many times inside
I've accepted this pain
And I won't look back now
I never will

You don't know
You don't care
You never have and you never will
[repeat: Chorus]

You made me realize
Everything I've ever known of love was pain
And the person you once were
Has died and rotted away
I've lived with this knife in my heart
As a reminder of what I can't be
I know all I do is hate you
There is nothing you can say or do

You were never part of my life
And you never will be

Unloved


9. Bloodsoaked Memories

Those wounds have been revealed
Clawing through this wasteland
No emotion lives, suffocate on hope
Swallow your last rational thought
It tastes of every heart you've devoured
Your veins constrict, they are choking you
Wrapped in vanity, you're dying.
Unveiled by searing hatred
You gasp for life, you can't hold me now
I've let you go, bleed into obscurity
Clawing through this wasteland
No emotion lives, suffocate on hope
Swallow your last rational thought.
It tastes of every heart you've devoured
Your veins constrict
They are choking you
Wrapped in vanity, you're dying


10. Hollow Ground

From nothing we have risen and from nothing we still rise

Take your life back
Fight, fight
Will you fight to take your life back?

Ask yourself what's truly yours in life
Are you in control or someone's slave?
All that you cherish, all that you love
In the blink of an eye can be taken from you
In moments of tragedy we bond
And in weakness clarity thrives
I've been blessed with the inspiration
To take what little I have and always strive

Sometimes surviving is all that you can do
I never claimed to have all the answers of the solutions
My satisfaction is knowing that my desires will not be killed
With a readiness to defend what is mine and never compromise

The foundation of our lives
Built on hollow ground
We must unlearn the prejudice
We must unlearn the lies

I've seen the calloused
I know the jaded
I've been disheartened, I've lost control
But I never crumbled in the face of adversity
And I always force myself to believe

(The foundation of our lives...)
Built on hollow ground
We must unlearn the prejudice
We must unlearn the lies

Are you willing to fight?
Are you willing?

(Take your life back...)
Fight, fight
Will you fight to take your life back?


11. Final Prayer

Destruction - in its purest form
No limit to the vicious damage done
Corruption - injustice with no remorse
Heinous disregard, our future's uncertain

But as life comes from the earth
It must return to the ash
Cleanse ourselves of those vile traits
And crawl back from annihilation
Worthless
We shatter lives
Ruthless
We decimate the earth

Final prayer
Final Prayer for the human race, we know our time is running out
Millions of people will suffer and die; by the hands of those in power
Final prayer
Final prayer for the human race
You must bow to your knees and repent for the human race

Awakened
To the blood stained face
For a world that can not be changed
Forever reminded
Of a nightmare that is every passing day

Worthless we shatter lives
Ruthless
We decimate the earth

(Final prayer...)


12. Smash Your Enemies

I hope I'm alive
To witness your demise
Make you feel my sorrow
Encompass all my pain
That I've felt for years
Dreading each dying day
Hanging by a thread
On the edge of my sanity

When I wake up the real nightmare begins

Will I make through my time in living hell?
Do I possess the strength to smash my fears into the ground?
I've tried to be strong
I've tried to overcome but I don't think I possess the strength to carry on
I'm torn between, and there's no right choice
I've gotta fight back
I won't be scarred for life.

Bring it up!


13. Healing To Suffer Again

I won't be chained to the earth
I feel cheated, so I cheat myself
I feel defeated, so I defeat myself
Drown my sorrows again and again
Push away and deny this misery
These feelings and instincts remain
I'm struggling to pull myself from my grave.

Let me be the one with the infinite
Let me be one
Let me be the one with the infinite
I won't be chained to the earth
I won't be chained to the earth

(I feel cheated...)

(Let me be one with the infinite...)

I just need the will
To suppress the urge
I can't suppress the urge
I've build so many barriers
I'm healing to suffer again
Time has given me no remorse
Spiritually bankrupt
Just give me the grace to oppose this sin
Haunted by the things I've done
Is this guilt and shame the price I pay
I hate myself for this weakness
I won't be chained to the earth.

[Rpt:] I won't be chained to the earth.


14. Judgment Strikes (Unbreakable)

Worthless, is what you made your life
Failure, is what you set yourself up for
You don't have the power
To realise your dreams
Now you want to take from me
Jealousy seethes through your callous words
So content you're visionless
Void of emotion
I pray for someone to release me from your grasp

It's evident, your guilt
It's evident, that this judgement strikes down on you

Unbreakable - and you're guilty
Unbreakable - I'm not going down without a fight

You try to break my world
You breached our trust to destroy me with lies
Now you've fallen you're nothing again
Live my hatred, its you I despise
Live my hate


15. Remain Nameless

If there's one thing in this world that I must do
It will be, to prove you wrong

Make you take back the lies
And bring the truth to the surface
Clean my slate and erase
All the black you've
Tarnished my name with
This is conviction
Of what I have inside you will never possess
And because you never understood how I lived
You try to disrespect
Well I've paid my fucking dues
And everything I have
I've made from nothing
I've done this all on my own
That's more than you can say for yourself

You disrespect the way I live
You take apart what I say
You try to judge me
Now I'm judging you
You disrespect the way I live
You take apart what I say
You try to judge me
Now I'm judging you
This time I'm judging you

The harder you try and break me
The harder I push on

If there's one thing in this world that I must do
It will be, prove you wrong

You never believed in this
And you never would admit your fault
You've always had everything handed to you
But the wealth has finally run out
I knew from the beginning
You had no heart or soul
I've always seen through your lies
And I'll always hate you for what you are

You disrespect the way I live
You take apart what I say
You try to judge me
Now I'm judging you

You disrespect the way I live
You take apart what I say
You try to judge me
Now I'm judging you. [x2]
This time I'm Judging you.

The harder, you try to break me
The harder, I push on
